Sanitary towel and tampon ads don't exactly portray periods in the most realistic way. If it's not strange-looking blue liquid being poured on pads, it's women jumping around splashing each other for reasons that remain unknown to us. Bodyform's latest ad shows something refreshingly different. An actual period. The ad opens with red liquid being poured onto a pad. Not a drop of blue dye in sight!

The ad is part of Bodyform's new #bloodnormal campaign, which aims to bring "blood out of the dark, onto our screens and into the conversation" in a bid to end period taboos. As part of the campaign, Bodyform surveyed over 10K men and women and found that 74 percent wanted "more realistic representation of periods" in ads. Read more...
