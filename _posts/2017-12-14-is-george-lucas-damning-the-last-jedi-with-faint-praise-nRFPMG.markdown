So news that Lucas told The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson his movie was "beautifully made," according to a THR report that quotes his private secretary, needs to be carefully parsed. It may not be the full-on compliment it sounds like. SEE ALSO: 'The Last Jedi' zero-spoiler review: See it. Just see it. Read more...
