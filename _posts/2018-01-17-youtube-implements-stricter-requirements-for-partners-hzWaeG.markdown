YouTube has been under fire for months over inappropriate content masquerading as kid-friendly videos and popular creators acting out of line . Now, Google has introduced stricter requirements for the video platform's YouTube Partners and Preferred programs over advertiser concerns , which could impact creators' earnings.

Last year, it slapped a 10,000 channel view minimum requirement on creators who want to apply for YouTube Partnership in order to prevent channels uploading stolen content and low-quality videos from making money. But it's "been clear over the last few months that [it needs] a higher standard," YouTube said in its announcement. Even older channels already earning money on the platform will be affected, though YouTube is giving them until February 20th. They'll be dropped from the program if they fail to meet the requirements next month, but they can apply again later. The company knows, howeve...
