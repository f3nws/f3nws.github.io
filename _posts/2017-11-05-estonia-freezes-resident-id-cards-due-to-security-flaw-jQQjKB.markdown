Estonia's residents use their mandatory national IDs to access pretty much anything, from online banking to online voting. So, it was a huge blow to the program when experts found a security flaw in the IDs' chip that makes it easy for bad players to impersonate and steal the identities of all 760,000 affected individuals.

Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Ratas said in a statement: "The functioning of an e-state is based on trust and the state cannot afford identity theft happening to the owner of an Estonian ID card. As far as we currently know, there has been no instances of e-identity theft, but the threat assessment of the Police and Border Guard Board and the Information System Authority indicates ...
