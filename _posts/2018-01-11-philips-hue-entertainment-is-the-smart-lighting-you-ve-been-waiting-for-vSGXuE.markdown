I was one of the first people to jump on the Philips Hue platform when it first came out, and for years, I've happily been using a dozen bulbs across my apartment. For now, it's a mild convenience -- I can turn off all my lights with one switch when I'm leaving the house, and it's fun to sync the TV lights to NFL touchdowns.

That means you get game-specific lighting that changes depending on what's going on in the game. For Overwatch , for example, lights will change color and tempo depending on which character you're playing, and what ability you're using at any one time. Sync a Hue LightStrip behind your screen to the game, and the ambient lighting can actually give you extra information in your peripheral vision. The Hue/Razer Chrome integration is live now, while th...
