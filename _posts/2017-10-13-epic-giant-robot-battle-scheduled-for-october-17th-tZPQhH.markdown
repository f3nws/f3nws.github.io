Are you ready for the world's first giant robot fight? (If your answer to that was "No," who even are you?) We've been waiting for a date for the MegaBots vs. Suidobashi duel, and now it's finally here. The fight will take place on October 17th, 2016 at 10:00 PM ET. It will be streamed worldwide on Twitch . If you miss the live stream, you can catch it on YouTube and Facebook immediately after the event concludes. This giant robot battle has been in the works for almost two years and was originally supposed to take place in August . The 16-foot-tall, 12-ton MegaBots Eagle Prime robot was built a team of American engineers, while Kuratas, a 13-footer that weighs 6.5 tons, was built by the Japanese company Suidobashi Heavy Industries. And now they will do battle for our enjoyment; the question is, who will reign supreme? Source: MegaBotsInc (Twitch)
