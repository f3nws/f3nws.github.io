Earlier this month, Apple provided us with some updated numbers regarding the App Store and, suffice it to say, business is booming. Throughout 2017, Apple notes that it paid out $26.5 billion to developers, a solid increase from the $20.3 billion Apple doled out to developers in 2016. All told, Apple has cumulatively paid out more than $86 billion to developers since the App Store opened in July of 2008.

Apps are the biggest component of Apple services and helped that segment gross over $57 billion in 2017, passing Fortune 100 level (net of developer payments). Beyond revenue earned by Apple and paid out to developers, Dediu astutely notes that Apple's influence on the mobile economy is even bigger than the already impressive figures would have you believe. To this point, many of the apps on the App Store serve as "front-ends to complex services" which are monetized in a myriad of ways. From Netflix and AirBnB to YouTube and Instagram, the notion of the App Store economy being an entit...
