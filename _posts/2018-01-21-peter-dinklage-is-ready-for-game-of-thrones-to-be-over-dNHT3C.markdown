Peter Dinklage is out in Utah to rep his new movie I Think We're Alone Now at the annual Sundance Film Festival and — of course — he's fielding questions about Game of Thrones . HBO's hit series is set to conclude with its eighth season in 2019, Dinklage seems like he's ready to bid farewell to Tyrion Lannister in an interview with Variety . "It’s time," he said.
