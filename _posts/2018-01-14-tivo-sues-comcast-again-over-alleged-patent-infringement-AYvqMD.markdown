TiVo says it will also file suits with the International Trade Commission regarding these patents. A Comcast spokesperson told us, "Comcast engineers independently created our X1 products and services, and through its litigation campaign against Comcast, Rovi seeks to charge Comcast and its customers for technology Rovi didn't create.
