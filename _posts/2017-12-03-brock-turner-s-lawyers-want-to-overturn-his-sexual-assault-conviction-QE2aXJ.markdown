Brock Turner is trying to have his sexual assault conviction overturned. Turner was convicted last year of assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster in 2015 and served three months at the county jail. What could have been a 14-year turn in a state penitentiary turned into a six month sentence — later cut in half, for good behavior — sparking outrage. SEE ALSO: Want to stop men like Harvey Weinstein from ruining women's lives? The solution is simple. Turner's lawyer believes the jury was unfairly prejudiced against him due to the use of the phrase, "behind a dumpster." He contends in a statement that this "implied an intent on the appellant's part to shield and sequester his activities" and "implied moral depravity, callousness and culpability on the appellant's part because of the inherent connotations of filth, garbage, detritus and criminal activity frequently associated with dumpsters."
