Google is working on some impressive artificial intelligence tricks. And, many of them are finding their way to the public. We can already interact with the company's digital assistant on our phones and through Google Home . Now, Google Lens is arriving on the original Pixel and Pixel XL . As Android Police notes, a number of users have spotted the feature in the Photos app on the first-gen handsets. We knew Lens was coming , but we didn't know when. In case you missed its unveiling in May, Lens uses computer vision to understand what's in your photos, videos, and the world around you. In the words of Engadget's Devindra Hardawar: "It's basically Google search for everything outside of screens." According to Reddit user /u/LaceratedCantaloupe , Lens randomly appeared on the Pixel XL's Photos app without an update, which suggests it could be part of a server-side rollout. Others, however, haven't been able to access it. Of course, this isn't the Assistant version of Lens, which is also due at some point this year. Photos, which recently received an AI-assisted upgrade , is a good fit for the tech -- making the feature-packed app even more powerful, as a result.
