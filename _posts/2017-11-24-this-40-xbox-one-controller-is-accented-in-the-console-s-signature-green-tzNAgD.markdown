This controller looks awesome! Several retailers are offering $40 Xbox controllers this Black Friday, but most of those deals are for standard colored controllers. Amazon has the same deal, but you can grab a sleek Grey/Green controller which reminds me a lot of the signature Xbox colors. It's also nice just because it's not the same Black or White offer that we always see. Experience the enhanced comfort and feel of the Xbox Wireless Controller Features a light grey design with Green Accents Play your favorite games on Windows 10 PCs and tablets. Plus, up to twice the wireless range (tested using the Xbox One S Console). Stay on target with textured grip Includes Bluetooth Technology for gaming on Windows 10 PCs and tablets This deal is also available at Best Buy. See at Amazon ...
