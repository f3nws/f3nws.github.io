By most accounts, Netflix's big-budget Will Smith blockbuster Bright is one of the worst movies of the year. It has a 32% score on Rotten Tomatoes -- critics don't just dislike it; they've eviscerated it as an affront to cinema . Yet despite that response, which is particularly disappointing for a film with a $90 million budget, Netflix has reportedly greenlit a sequel with Will Smith attached. That doesn't make much sense at first, especially since the company can't bank on big box office returns like other studios. But for Netflix, it turns out hype matters more than quality. Last year, we noted that Netflix never slowed down in 2016. It brought its streaming service to more countries around the globe, invested even more in original content, added offline viewing, and finally saw the fruits of a deal it made with Disney back in 2012. For the most part, Netflix continued with that strategy over the past 12 months. But the addition of major exclusives like War Machine , a $60 million military drama starring Brad Pitt, and Death Note , an anime adaptation that cost between $40 and $50 million, aimed to make the company a direct Hollywood competitor. (Netflix also spent more than $100 million for the rights to Martin Scorsese's The Irishman .) Bright , with its huge budget, world-famous star and Christmas release, was the crown jewel of Netflix's 2017 plan. Why trek out to a cinema in the cold when you could just hit a button and enjoy a new Will Smith movie on your couch? After all, you won't have to deal with rising ticket prices, expensive snacks and the hell of unruly audiences. That's been Netflix's value proposition for years, but now it's making that argument with the sort of blockbuster that would have sold out theaters a decade ago. Unfortunately, since Netflix doesn't release stats for its films, we don't have any numbers to back up the company's decision that Bright is successful enough to warrant a sequel. It could be that it saw an uptick in subscribers ahead of the film's release. Perhaps fewer people canceled their subscriptions than usual in D...
