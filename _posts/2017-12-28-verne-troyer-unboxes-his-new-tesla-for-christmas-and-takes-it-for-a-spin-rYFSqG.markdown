Actor Verne Troyer got a sweet new ride for Christmas, and he takes us for a spin in this video on his YouTube channel. It's a Tesla.... Model S for Kids, by Radio Flyer. ("Ages 3 to 8... I'm 48," Troyer points out in the video.) He manages to get it out of the box and shows us its features, which are pretty sweet. You can charge the battery and plug it in, just like the adult-size Tesla. Troyer's got a need for speed so he takes it to a scorching 6 mph. Make sure you stick around for the outtakes at the end â€” looks like Troyer is a lot of fun to film. Read more... More about Videos , Tesla , Unboxing , Verne Troyer , and Culture
