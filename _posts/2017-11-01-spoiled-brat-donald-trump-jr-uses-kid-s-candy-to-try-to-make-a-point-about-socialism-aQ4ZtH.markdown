Very rich person Donald Trump Jr., who inherited his wealth from his father, would like to make a point about socialism. To do it he's going to use his innocent child, Chloe. The president's son tweeted a photo of his daughter Chloe looking sad on Tuesday holding up a bucket filled with Halloween candy. "I’m going to take half of Chloe’s candy tonight & give it to some kid who sat at home. It’s never to early to teach her about socialism," he wrote. OK.
