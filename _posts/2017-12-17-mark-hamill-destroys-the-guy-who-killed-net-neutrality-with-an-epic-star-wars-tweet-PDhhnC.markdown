Net Neutrality is dead thanks to the Federal Communication Commission's idiot chairman Ajit Pai, and Mark Hamill is pissed. The Last Jedi star took some time out of the movie's huge opening weekend to rip Pai a new one on Twitter, and man was it an epic diss of galactic proportions. SEE ALSO: Whatever you do, don't watch 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' in 3D You may recall that Pai released a comically stupid video called "7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality" the day before the FCC voted to kill Net Neutrality. In the asinine video, Pai dresses up Santa, fidget spins, and wields a lightsaber while telling viewers that they'll still be able to stream their favorite movies and be part of their favorite fan communities. Which is partially true, but also fundamentally dishonest: Dismantling Net Neutrality will hurt consumers the most. (Because who wouldn't want to pay more to your Internet Service Provider for less, because they'll control which content gets in the fast lane?) Read more...
