It’s difficult to overstate how important it is to have a dash cam in your car. They’re not just for police and taxi drivers, they’re for anyone who wants a record of events that’s available at all times. If you get into an accident that’s not your fault, a dash cam ensures that it’s not your word against the other driver — there’s proof of what happened. If you don’t already have one, we highly recommend checking out the VAVA Dash Cam , which is on sale right now at its lowest price ever (just $109.99 with coupon code VAVACAM1). It has a phenomenal rating at 4.5 stars, and it has a cool feature no other dash cam has: The ability to rotate 360° so it can record in any direction you want. Here’s what you need to know from the product page: Clear 1080p 60fps HD Videos Even at Night: Advanced SONY STARVIS Series IMX291 CMOS sensor is paired with 6 glass lenses and an infrared lens for sharper, more detailed captures, both night and day 360° All-Around View: Swivels up to 360° to capture footage in front, around, and even inside the car; wide-angle lens covers up to 5 car lanes; and a built-in mic allows to record audio inside the car Included Snapshot Remote Button: Sits on the steering wheel and allows you to quickly capture the unexpected as it literally crosses your path; shoot a 20 second short video with a longer press of the button Full-Featured VAVA Dash Cam Mobile App: Share photos and videos over social media or with an insurance company without taking out the SD card; includes live video feed and GPS tracking, travel journal, and photo filtering functions. Note: SD CARD NOT INCLUDED. G-sensor for Emergency Video Recording: 3-axis G-sensor detects collisions and captures footage for up to 20 seconds; 320mAh built-in battery allows for G-senor activated recordings in parking mode. Note: Due to an Android bug affecting all dash cams, the phone cannot access mobile data while it is connected to the VAVA Dash Cam’s Wi-Fi. If you want to use your phone’s data network, simply connect to the VAVA Dash Cam’s Wi-Fi when you need to watch the recorded videos only.
