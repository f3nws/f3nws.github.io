Brooke Amelia Peterson, who filmed a video of the iPhone X before its release, revealed in a YouTube video that her father had been fired for letting her get the footage. Peterson's father was a radio frequency engineer at Apple. She filmed the iPhone X in the Apple cafeteria, in the open, but no one said anything. The video went viral and Apple asked her to remove it, but her father still lost his job. In the original video , Peterson swipes through some of the new features of the iPhone X, including the 3D emoji and large display. "It was an innocent mistake," Peterson emphasizes, adding that she is not bitter or angry and neither is her family. She hopes Apple will learn from the experience to tighten its policies and consistency in upholding them. Read more... More about Tech , Apple , Viral Video , Iphone X , and Tech
