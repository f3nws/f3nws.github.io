Time for some Instagram goodness from everyone's favourite Rock. SEE ALSO: 'The Rock' discusses the possibility of running for President in 2020 On Monday, Dwayne Johnson took to Instagram to share some pretty special news — and he shared it in typical Johnson fashion. Our Jasmine Lia would like to make a big announcement - IT’S A GIRL! 🌺 @laurenhashianofficial and I are boundlessly grateful for this blessing as this spring we’ll welcome our second baby. Plus, Jazzy is excited to boss around and protect her lil’ sis. And once again, big daddy is completely surrounded by beautiful estrogen and loving, powerful female mana. All girls. One dude. And a boy dog. I wouldn’t have it any other way. #ItsAGirl #GratefulMan #TequilaTime 🌺🙏🏾🥃 A post shared by therock (@therock) on Dec 11, 2017 at 2:30pm PST Read more...
