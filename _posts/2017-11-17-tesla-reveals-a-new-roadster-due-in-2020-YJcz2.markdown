At Tesla's Semi event , the automaker dropped its new Roadster . It'll have a 620-mile range via a 200kWh battery pack."You'll be able to travel from LA to San Francisco and back without recharging," CEO Elon Musk said. The new Tesla Roadster will do zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds, and it'll blast through a quarter mile in 8.9 seconds, before reaching a top speed of over 250 MPH. Oh, and it's a four-seater. Musk called it, "a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars." The car is due in 2020 so start saving up all your nickels and dimes now -- the cost is $200,000, with a $50,000 reservation to get in line for a base model. Of course, there are also 1,000 "Founders Edition" Roadsters also available, provided you're willing to pony up for the full $250k price right away. A limited number of folks that attended tonight's event and put down a $50,000 deposit on the Roadster will get a ride in the car. Source: Tesla Roadster
