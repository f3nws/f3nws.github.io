The developers of the game Fortnite filed a lawsuit against a 14-year-old who allegedly used cheating software to get a competitive edge in multiplayer. His mother is fighting back. Epic Games took cheating punishment a step further than usual in October when it not only banned two Fortnite Battle Royale players for cheating but decided to sue them . Now, a month later, the mother of one of the alleged cheaters has responded and is calling the entire lawsuit into question, admonishing Epic for publicly naming her son, who is a minor.
