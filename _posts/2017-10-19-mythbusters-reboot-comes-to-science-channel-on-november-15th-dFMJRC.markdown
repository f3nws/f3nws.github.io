What do you do when your highly-successful reality show goes out with a bang ? If you're Discovery-owned Science Channel, you quickly reboot it and find new hosts to replace the iconic ones. If you're a fan of the original and willing to give the new guys a chance to prove themselves to be as awesome as Adam and Jamie are, then your'e in luck. The new version of Mythbusters , a much-loved show that reveled in DIY gadgetry and science, is set to air its first of 14 episodes on November 15th. Jon Lung and Brian Louden will anchor the new series, which aims to continue the original's mission to debunk fantastic claims and myths using actual science. The first episode will have the leads testing to see if an airbag can be lethal to front-seat passengers who put their feet on the dashboard. Of course, they'll use a cadaver to do so. In addition, the team will test out whether a bad guy or zombie will hold still for a dramatic pause if you decapitate them with enough force like they do in the movies. A rocket-powered sword will be their instrument of truth. Louden and Lung won a national talent search in Mythbusters: the Search , beating out 9 other teams who wanted to host the reboot. Louden has a biology degree and has trained in emergency medicine while Lung is an engineer and product designer. Source: Mythbusters/YouTube
