Spoiler alert: This post contains major spoilers for Justice League . As far as superhero movies go, Justice League runs a very reasonable length. But it makes use of all of its 119 minutes, squeezing in not one but two extra scenes in the credits. One is a fun little moment between two characters, while the other teases something far more sinister. Here's what we make of the Justice League end credits scenes. SEE ALSO: Here are 7 things you probably didn't know about the Justice League 1. Superman races the Flash Fly your colours today brothers and sisters. Its National Superhero day! I personally just want to thank all of you guys and gals for keeping us so entertained and setting such a fantastic example for superhero fans, young and old, around the world. @PrattPrattPratt @Gal_Gadot @vancityreynolds @ChrisHemsworth @BenAffleck @RobertDowneyJr @MarkRuffalo @PrideOfGypsies @Rehsifyar @TheHughJackman @MargotRobbie @JoelKinnaman @ZoeSaldana @DaveBautista @VinDiesel @paulbettany @renner4real @samuelljackson @aarontaylorjohnson @officiallyelizabetholsen @nicholashoult @jamesmcavoyrealdeal @booboodaddy @sophiet @kodismitmcpheeofficial @alexandrashipppp @brielarson @tomholland2013 @imsebastianstan @chadwickboseman #DonCheadle #PaulRudd #AnthonyMackie #ChrisEvans #BradleyCooper #EzraMiller #ScarlettJohansson #SuperheroDay #TyeSheridan #BenedictCumberbatch #WillSmith Read more...
