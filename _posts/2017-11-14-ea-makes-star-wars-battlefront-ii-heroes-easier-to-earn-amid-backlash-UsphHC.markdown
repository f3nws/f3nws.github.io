Video game studios sometimes tinker with their games until release day, but Electronic Arts is making another last-minute change to soothe legions of irate fans. After the high price to unlock heroes in the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront II caused fans to revolt, EA relented . The publisher told fans in a blog post that, effective immediately, a handful of iconic characters including Luke and Darth Vader would be far easier to earn. EA cut down the cost of 'top heroes' by 75 percent.

Unfortunately, overzealous fans have taken it way too far and harassed the game's developers -- even sending death threats , which, and I can't believe I have to write this, is never okay. It's the second time EA has tweaked the game's reward mechanics following backlash. After the open beta last month, players and critics were outraged that anyone could get a noticeable advantage in multiplayer by buying randomized loot crates. Subsequently, EA publicly responded to the feedback and reserved the most powerful of upgrades for merit-only unlocking. In its blog post, EA note...
