While you can put your phone on airplane mode to prevent an agent from looking through emails, notes, documents and files saved in the cloud, that's definitely not enough for the ACLU. The organization, which filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security over this exact issue last year, said in a statement : "It is positive that CBP's policy would at least require officers to have some level of suspicion before copying and using electronic methods to search a traveler's electronic device. However, this policy still falls far short of what the Constitution requires -- a search warrant based on probable cause. The policy would still enable off...
