Amazon has been running early Black Friday sales for a full week, but now it's time to remove "early" from the equation. Black Friday isn't just a Friday anymore, it's a full week of deals that culminates with one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Your Black Friday doesn't have to be so busy though, because Amazon just kicked things off with the best pricing of the year on some of its most popular gadgets. The Kindle Paperwhite drops to $89.99 in Amazon's big Black Friday 2017 sale, and the regular Kindle is just $49.99 right now. Meanwhile the Fire HD 10 tablet is on sale for $99.99 and Dash Buttons can be had for $2.50 a piece (and you still get the $5 credit the first time you use one). Check out all of Amazon's just-launched Black Friday deals below, and you can shop the site's Countdown to Black Friday sale right here .
