Yesterday we got an exterior view of the first flight for Blue Origin's Crew Capsule 2.0 , but now the company is back to show us what it's like from inside. Its plan is to offer "space tourism" trips that take six people at a time beyond the Karman Line to experience weightlessness and views through the capsule's "biggest windows in space." The test capsule isn't looking as polished as the concept images we'd seen before, but this 11-minute video is a pretty good preview of what customers can expect when Blue Origin starts putting real people on top of its New Shepard spacecraft. Plus, according to Jeff Bezos, passengers will be able to get out of their seats to experience zero-g, and on the ground perhaps enjoy the company of this Blue2D2 landing pad robot. Take that, SpaceX drone ship. Full video of Mannequin Skywalker's ride to space. Unlike him, you'll be able to get out of your seat during the zero gee part of the flight. And ignore the pinging sound – it's just from one of the experiments on this flight. #NewShepard @blueorigin https://t.co/dJ5VEeaWb6 pic.twitter.com/qGQC1vfW7D — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 15, 2017 First use of our landing pad bot #Blue2D2 . @blueorigin pic.twitter.com/Ht2P7yVwEs — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 15, 2017 Source: Blue Origin (YouTube)
