This post contains spoilers from The Walking Dead Season 8, episode 7, "Time for After." Comic fans got one hell of an unnecessary scare on the latest episode of The Walking Dead . It really looked like fan favorite Daryl Dixon was about to find himself in a situation horrifyingly reminiscent of an infamous character death in the book. In Robert Kirkman's graphic novels, just like in the show, a group of people head to the Sanctuary to attack Negan and his Saviors once it's surrounded by walkers. A character named Holly drives a truck into the Saviors' base and is injured in the process.
