E! News host Catt Sadler has left the network over a gender wage gap disparity. Sadler learned that her male co-host made significantly more than she did â€“ almost twice as much. Sadler was recently named co-host of Daily Pop in addition to her role on E! News , and realized around the same time that her salary was disproportionate to her male colleague's. (She is likely referring to Daily Pop co-host Jason Kennedy, thought she doesn't name him). "The gender pay gap is shrinking, although admittedly we have a long way to go," Sadler wrote in a statement about her exit. "And well, I learned this first hand. My team and I asked for what I know I deserve and were denied repeatedly." Read more... More about Entertainment , Television , Gender Wage Gap , E News , and Catt Sadler
