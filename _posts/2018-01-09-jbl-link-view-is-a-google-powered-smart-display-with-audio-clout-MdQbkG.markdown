While Amazon might have been the first to come to market with a smart display -- the Echo Show and the Echo Spot , respectively -- it's now no longer the only ones. At this year's CES, Google is announcing a slew of smart displays from several companies, and one of them is the JBL Link View from Harman International. Think of it as a Google Home, but with a touch screen. Measuring 13 by 5.9 by 3.9 inches, the overall Link View looks a bit like a halved football, but with a display set in the middle. That display measures 8 inches across and features a HD 1280 x 720 resolution. And, because of the Google partnership, it works with Google Assistant as well as Nest cams and most other Google products. As we saw from the Echo Show as well as the Echo Spot, having a display in addition to a smart speaker is phenomenally useful. You can use the display for video calls, watching YouTube, follow step-by-step recipes and yes, watch YouTube clips. Though there are many smart displays announced here at CES, the Link View might have an edge over the competition when it comes to audio. Thanks to its Harman roots, the JBL Link View comes with two front-facing 10W speakers, a rear-facing passive radiator for deeper bass, plus 24 bit HD audio streaming. There's also a built-in Chromecast for multi-room playback. There's no word on pricing just yet, but according to JBL, it'll be in stores by summer this year.
