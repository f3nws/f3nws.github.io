A team of researchers of Japanese researchers say they’ve discovered the holy grail of mobile computing: a new type of glass that can heal itself from cracks. Published in the journal Science, a team of researchers from the University of Tokyo believe they’ve found a hard glass-like polymer called “polyetherthioureas” that can heal itself with mild heat and hand pressure. According to the researchers: High mechanical robustness and healing ability tend to be mutually exclusive. In most cases, heating to high temperatures, on the order of 120 degrees Celsius or more, to reorganize their cross-linked networks is necessary for the… This story continues at The Next Web
