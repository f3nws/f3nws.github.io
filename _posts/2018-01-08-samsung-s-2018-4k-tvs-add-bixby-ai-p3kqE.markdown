Even if you can't spring for an 85-inch 8K TV or a screen large enough to be called The Wall , Samsung still has something new for your next TV. Its 2018 Smart TV platform is getting an upgrade with the addition of its Bixby AI voice control platform, as well as integrated SmartThings technology. That home automation hub support will "offer easier sharing, connectivity, and an overall simplified way to control the television and sync with other devices." Finally, a new universal guide will keep up with the likes of Apple, Roku and TiVo by searching for content within apps and suggesting new things you to watch.
