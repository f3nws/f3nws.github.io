Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission. If you’ve done any international traveling, you probably already know that not all charging solutions are created equal. There are the ones that come with converters and outlet adapters…and that thing you haven’t quite figured out yet. Then there are the ones with different outlet adapters depending on where you’re going (turns out those are super easy to lose in a suitcase). SEE ALSO: Disorganized techies will love this device But the Twist Plus+ World Charging Station is a welcome departure from the typical traveling woes. All you need is the Twist to charge your devices — no converters and no random cords (seriously, where do they even come from?) It has a universal AC power outlet, so you can plug it in anywhere when you’re traveling internationally. Once it’s plugged in, just plug in your devices — it’s got four USB ports and a port specifically for your MacBook, so you don’t need to go searching for outlets wherever you’re staying. The best part? It’s compact—so it doesn’t need its own suitcase. Read more... More about Apple , Travel , Mac , International , and Usb
