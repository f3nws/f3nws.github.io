Sonos makes the best wireless speakers on the planet, period. From sound quality and design to service integration and user experience, it simply doesn't get any better. That said, Sonos speakers haven't always been a good option for many people, since there are so many other wireless speakers out there that cost so much less. If you're in the market for a new sound bar, feel free to bargain hunt since the Sonos PlayBar costs $700. But if you're looking for a compact wireless speaker, there's really no excuse anymore for passing up the Sonos Play:1 Compact Wireless Speaker . This amazing little speaker typically sells for $200, but it's only $138 right now on Amazon. That makes it far less expensive than speakers that are nowhere near as good, and you'd have to be crazy to get anything else. Here's what you need to know from the product page: Play:1 is our compact, surprisingly powerful speaker. It’s a perfect fit for bookshelves, counters, and other snug places. So now you can enjoy great-sounding music anywhere. Connect your Play:1 to any Amazon Echo or Alexa-enabled device, then just ask for the music you love. Play different songs in different rooms at the same time. Or, pump one song in perfect sync, throughout your home. Set-up in five minutes using your home Wi-Fi. Easily expand your home audio system over time by adding wireless speakers to additional rooms whenever you’re ready. Wirelessly Stream all your favorite music services like Amazon Music, Pandora, Apple Music, and Spotify. Perfect for home theater rears or a stereo pair. Wall mountable.
