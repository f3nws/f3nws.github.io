We've covered the Nebula Mars portable home theater a few times here on the site, and we've gotten great feedback from readers who have purchased one. We've also received a bunch of feedback from people who didn't want to purchase it though, because they said to was too expensive. That's probably true for most people who don't have a regular need for a portable cinema solution, but a new addition to Anker's Nebula lineup was released on Monday and it might be exactly what those people have been looking for. The Nebula Capsule Smart Portable Projector is unlike any other mobile projector you've seen. It's essentially a more compact version of the Mars, complete with a bright projection lamp and built-in 360° speakers. Unlike the Mars, however, the Nebula Capsule is about the same size as a can of soda, so you can bring it with you anywhere to project a screen up to 100 inches that lasts for up to 4 hours of video playback per charge. It also connects to your iPhone or Android phone wirelessly so you don't need to worry about carrying around extra cables! Here are some of the key details from the product page: REMARKABLE CLARITY AND CONTRAST: DLP's advanced IntelliBright algorithms deliver remarkably bright, vivid picture up to 100 inches big. 360° SPEAKER: Equipped with a powerful omnidirectional speaker to pump out sound in every direction. SUPPER PORTABLE: A seamless aluminum body ensures greater durability and a meager 15 oz weight to effortlessly go wherever you do. ANDROID 7.1: Run Streaming and Media Apps Flawlessly. Seamlessly display content from Netflix, Youtube, and more for endless entertainment. WHAT'S IN THE BOX: Nebula Capsule, power adapter, manual, remote, 12-month warranty and our friendly customer service.(Note: Does not support Chromecast or Windows Miracast. Capsule mirrors User-Generated Content, such as PPTs, PDFs, pictures, and videos. Copyrighted content cannot be mirrored.)
