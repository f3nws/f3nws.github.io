Sesame Street just won a hefty award to bring educational programming and a humanitarian response to children displaced by war and conflict in the Middle East. Sesame Street and the International Rescue Committee were awarded a $100 million MacArthur Foundation grant on Wednesday to build an early-childhood education program for kids dealing with "toxic stress" in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria. An estimated 9.4 million children will be able to use the specialized programming.
