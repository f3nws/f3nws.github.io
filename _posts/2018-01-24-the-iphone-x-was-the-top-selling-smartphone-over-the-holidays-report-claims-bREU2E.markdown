There’s much talk and confusion right now about the iPhone X being discontinued once its replacements arrive this year, on account that it’s not meeting sales estimates.

And when it does release the numbers for the period, don’t expect it to tell anyone how many iPhone X units it sold. In addition to strong iPhone X sales, the iPhone SE, 6s, 7, and 8 also “shipped well” in Q4. “Apple is looking at its best performance to date, all thanks to the massive changes it made to its portfolio in Q3,” Canalys analy...
