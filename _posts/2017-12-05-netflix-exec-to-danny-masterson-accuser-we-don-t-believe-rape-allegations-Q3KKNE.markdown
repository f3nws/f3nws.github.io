Netflix's zero-tolerance stance on sexual abuse allegations is coming into question. The Huffington Post reported Monday on a conversation between a woman who has accused Danny Masterson, star of Netflix show The Ranch , of raping her; and an executive at the company, who were at the same youth soccer game over the weekend. When the woman confronted the executive, director of global kids content Andy Yeatman, he told her that he and other Netflix higher-ups "don't believe" the accusers â€“ without knowing that she was one.
