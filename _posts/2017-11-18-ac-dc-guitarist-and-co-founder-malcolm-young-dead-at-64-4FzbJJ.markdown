Malcolm Young, whose crunching guitar provided the rhythmic backbone of AC/DC for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at the age of 64. Young, who co-founded the Australian hard rock band with his younger brother Angus in 1973, stuck with the band — and, by most accounts, served as its leader — until he retired in 2014. His retirement was prompted by the onset of dementia. SEE ALSO: The 10 most Instagrammed shows at Coachella The band confirmed Young's passing in a statement posted to its Facebook page. The post also includes a second, more personal statement from Angus himself. "As his brother, it is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special," Angus wrote. "He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever." Read more... More about Entertainment , Music , Ac Dc , Malcolm Young , and Angus Young
