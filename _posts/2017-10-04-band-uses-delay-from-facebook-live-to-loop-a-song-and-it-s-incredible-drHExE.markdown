Any time there's a live streaming video, there will always be a little bit of delay in the feed. If you've ever been on a conference call, the short delay is noticeable enough to make things slightly awkward, but on services like Facebook Live, the delay can be multiple seconds. Most people live with it, the band The Academic decided to embrace it. Using the delayed audio and video from a Facebook Live, the band managed to create a loop version of their song "Bear Claws." It's a little easier to understand if you actually see it in action, but essentially, the band performs for a Facebook Live feed that's then projected behind them. They manage to sync up and perform with the same delayed feed a few seconds later, and as the song progresses, it gets more and more interesting. Read more...
