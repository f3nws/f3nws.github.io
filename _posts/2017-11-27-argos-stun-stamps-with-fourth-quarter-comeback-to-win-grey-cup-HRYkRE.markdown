OTTAWA—If the Canadian Football League has taught us anything, maybe it’s that you should never count out the Toronto Argonauts. They have gone bankrupt. They have bled fans. More than once, people have wondered: Will they vanish? Will they fold? Much more than a century later, here they are. In this Grey Cup, they could have folded.

It can be a cliche to call things Canadian, but snowblowers and snow plows, Shania Twain and sled dogs, and Calgary versus Toronto in the nation’s capital all qualify. This Grey Cup looked like a Grey Cup, even if snow games are few and far between. It felt like Canadian football. And there was nobody better at Canadian football than Calgary this season, until the end.
