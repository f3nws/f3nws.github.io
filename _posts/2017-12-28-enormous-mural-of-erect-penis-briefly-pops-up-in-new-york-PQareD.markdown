As the headline might suggest, this story contains images of, well, a rather enormous penis. For a brief spell over the festive period, the Lower East Side had an enormous erection. No, really it did. A huge, four-storey mural of a turgid penis popped up on a building on Broome St. in New York City on Christmas Eve. But, a mere matter of days after the phallus made its debut on the street, the mural was painted over at the request of the building's landlord.

The giant penis was intended as a complement to a nearby super-sized mural of a vagina on Pike Street. Read more... More about New York City , Penis , Street Art , Mural , and Culture
