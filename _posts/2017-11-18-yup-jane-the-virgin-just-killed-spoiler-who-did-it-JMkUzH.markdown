Spoilers for Friday's episode of Jane the Virgin To be fair, Narrator did warn us. A few episodes ago, Narrator told us that this season one of six characters (Rafael, Petra, Luisa, Alba, Anezka, or Magda) would die. It's the oldest trick in the book, after all. Well friends, Friday's episode ended with Petra discovering her evil( ish ) twin sister Anezka, dead, hanging from the ceiling, and a tease from Narrator: She didn't kill herself. Gasp! SEE ALSO: Read an excerpt from 'Jane the Virgin' companion novel 'Snow Falling' â€” but be prepared to cry This is devastating news for those of us who love to watch Yael Grobglas continue to impress by hilariously portraying both twins, but from a storytelling perspective, it certainly makes sense: You can only pull the old switcharoo so many times. I'm excited to see how this plot unfolds, and what mayhem at the Marbella ensues because of it. (Seriously, how many murders does it take to shut down a hotel?!) Read more...
