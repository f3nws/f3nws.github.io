Popular space MMO Eve Online has been doing pretty well lately, bringing a massive map , galactic trade economies and the vastness of space to players over its 14-year history. It's made several moves to keep folks interested in its PC-based game title, too. Developer CCP Games, has made Eve Online free to download and play while also allowing players to participate in finding exoplanets in real life. Now the team is partnering with mobile game developer PlayRaven to bring Eve Online- style multiplayer action to mobile devices. Dubbed " Project Aurora ," the upcoming title for iOS and Android is set to launch later in 2018. This isn't the first time Eve Online has been represented in other titles, like Dust 514 and Valkyrie , but it is the first foray into a mobile presence. Project Aurora will be set in the same universe as Eve Online , but will not be integrated with the MMO, PlayRaven confirmed to Engadget. "We're all long-time fans of CCP and EVE Online , so we're immensely proud and honored to be working with such a legendary developer and beloved franchise. It's really a dream come true to have the opportunity to create a new EVE experience on mobile," said Lasse Seppänen, co-founder and CEO at PlayRaven in a statement. Hilmar Veigar Pétursson, CEO of CCP Games, is also excited at the prospect. "For years and years we have wanted to bring the EVE Universe to mobile devices in a way that is tailored to the platform and EVE fans. We wanted to find a partner who is passionate about EVE , has a track record of producing high quality and deep mobile games and is capable of creating completely new experiences on mobile," he said in the same statement. "PlayRaven fit the bill perfectly."
