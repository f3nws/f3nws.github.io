You own it, you better never let it go. Eminem's lawyers would've been roaring this on Tuesday, after New Zealand's High Court ruled that the country's National Party was in breach of the rapper's copyright for music featured in a 2014 election ad. New Zealand's National Party had one shot, one opportunity to seize everything they ever wanted: re-election. So, for their 2014 campaign, they decided to rip off one of the world's most immediately recognisable (and Academy Award-winning) songs, 2002's "Lose Yourself," featured in Eminem's feature film debut 8 Mile .
