What is Nintendo LABO ? Good question! Announced on Wednesday evening, Nintendo LABO is a new supplemental gaming line that's unlike anything you've ever seen before. In a nutshell, it's like Google Cardboard on steroids. Nintendo LABO kits are do-it-yourself kits that come as flat cardboard sheets. You pop out the pieces outlined on the cardboard and then follow the animated directions on your Nintendo Switch to assemble the LABO product. The end result is an interactive creation the likes of which you've never seen. You definitely need to watch the video to fully grasp Nintendo LABO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Bd3HUMkyU Want to be one of the first people in the world to get your hands on Nintendo LABO? The very first kit — the Nintendo LABO Robot Kit — is available for preorder right now on Amazon. Grab it right now and you're guaranteed to have your Nintendo LABO robot on launch day!
