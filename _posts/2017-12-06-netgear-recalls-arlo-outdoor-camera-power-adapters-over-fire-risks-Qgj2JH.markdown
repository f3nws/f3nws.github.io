If you bought one of Netgear's Arlo outdoor cameras and then snapped up an extra power adapter just in case, you may want to sit up and take notice. Neetgear and the Consumer Product Safety Commission are recalling Arlo's aftermarket power adapter after receiving seven reports of the cord overheating and melting, in one case leading to a fire. Only 7,700 affected adapters were sold in North America between June and October, but that still presents a sizeable risk. This shouldn't affect the adapter that came with your camera, so you can keep using it as long as you didn't have to swap out the original. Still, this underscores the usefulness of having a backup for a security camera -- you don't have to leave your backyard unguarded, even if it's just for a short while. Source: CPSC
