Twitter temporarily suspended Rose McGowan on Wednesday night, according to an Instagram post from the actress. McGowan has been in the news this week as a vocal critic of both Harvey Weinstein and, subsequently, Ben Affleck, whom she labeled a liar and told him to "fuck off" following his own condemnation of Weinstein. Detailed in an email screenshot posted on McGowan's Instagram, the temporary suspension allows her to browse Twitter â€” but she is prohibited from sending tweets, retweeting or liking.
