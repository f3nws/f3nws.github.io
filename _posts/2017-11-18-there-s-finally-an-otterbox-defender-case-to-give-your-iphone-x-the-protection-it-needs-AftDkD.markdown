Apple's iPhone X isn't just the best iPhone the world has ever seen, it's the best smartphone the world has ever seen. Period. The gorgeous new display, powerful new processor, class-leading camera, and sleek new design come at a price: the glass on the front and back of the iPhone X is easy to break, making the iPhone X the most fragile phone Apple has ever made. If you tend to be hard on your smartphones, a thin little plastic case isn't going to do the trick. Want real protection? Check out the OtterBox DEFENDER SERIES Case for iPhone X , which was just discounted by a few bucks on Amazon. Here are some highlights from the product page: Compatible with iPhone X Multi-layer defense: solid inner shell and soft outer cover (SCREENLESS to accommodate new technology) Belt-clip holster included that doubles as a kickstand for hand-free media viewing. Port covers keep out dust and debris Includes OtterBox limited lifetime warranty (see website for details) and 100% authentic.
