On the opening episode of the 29th season of The Simpsons (yes, there's been that many), the show closed with a moment of solidarity for the people of Puerto Rico. A still of all The Simpsons characters remained on screen for five seconds at the end of the show, according to EW . It featured the Puerto Rico flag and Marge Simpson holding a sign with the word "unido," â€” that's "united" in English.
