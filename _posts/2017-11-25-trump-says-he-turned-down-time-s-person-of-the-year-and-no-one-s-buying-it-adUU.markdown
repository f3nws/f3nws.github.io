Unless you repressed all memories of 2016 (and who could blame you), you'll remember that Time named Donald Trump "Person of the Year." Now, the president is claiming that the magazine asked him again this year but, like, urgh who can even be bothered? SEE ALSO: Sorry, Cards Against Humanity can't stop Trump's wall In a tweet Friday, the president took time from his busy schedule of getting absolutely nothing from his agenda done to make a bold claim about rejecting the magazine's honor for 2017. Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017 Read more...
