I can’t blame you if you think you’ve already had enough winter and you’re looking forward to spring and summer. But even though you can’t wait to bathe in the sun, too much sun can still be quite bad for you. Thankfully, there’s an app for that, and it works with both the iPhone and Android devices. What's even more interesting is that L’Oreal created it to work alongside its newest wearable, a device that doesn’t need a battery to tell you when the sun is bad for you.

Here’s what UV Sense looks like when torn apart: L’Oreal says the wearable is powered by the mobile phone and activated by UVA and UVB rays. The mobile iPhone and Android apps will offer users data about UV exposure, which should help them either seek shade or reapply sunscreen. Last year, the company launched a UV exposure monitor called My UV Patch , which is a skin sensor that can monitor UV rays. L’Oreal’s La Roche-Posay says that more than one million patches were distributed to consumers in 37 countries, all...
