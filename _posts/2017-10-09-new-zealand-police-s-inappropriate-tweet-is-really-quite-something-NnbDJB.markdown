Police and memes are often a clumsy mixture at best. While we'll admit our appreciation for their animal posts , New Zealand Police have really outdone themselves with an errant tweet on Monday. SEE ALSO: 'Phantom labeller' causes mischief at New Zealand museum The tweet is titled, "When we have to tell someone their family member has died in a crash," and it's accompanied with a GIF of The Office's Michael Scott saying "This is the worst!" It's pretty bad, unless you're a fan of gallows humour. OK, it's only Monday, but this tweet by NZ Police already takes the booby prize for social media fail of the week.
