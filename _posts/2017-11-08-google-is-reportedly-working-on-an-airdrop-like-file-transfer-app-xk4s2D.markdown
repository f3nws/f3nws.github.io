Google has a history of working on apps and services for more rural, data-lacking locations around the globe, like its mobile wallet for users in India and a search-lite app for Indonesian folks. Now, according to a now-pulled app on Google Play reported by 9to5Google , the company is testing a new Files Go app. According to now-pulled Play Store images, the app is intended to transfer files wirelessly, even without an internet connection, much like Apple's AirDrop tech. The app seems fairly basic now, according to screenshots shared by 9to5Google . There's a storage tab to show users how much space is available on their device, and a files tab that groups content into different types, like images, video, and audio. The app also includes options to clear app caches, delete apps that aren't used often and remove spam or duplicate images, says the site. One screenshot hints that file transfers work via Bluetooth, though that's not confirmed. We've reached out to Google for more details and will update this post when we hear back.
