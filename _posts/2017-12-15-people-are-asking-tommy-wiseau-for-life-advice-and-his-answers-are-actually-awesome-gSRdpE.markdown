Despite all the press surrounding The Disaster Artist , there's still plenty of unanswered questions about Tommy Wiseau. Where did he get all the money to finance The Room ? Where is he really from? How old is he? Is Tommy Wiseau even his real name? And so on and so forth. SEE ALSO: Should you watch 'The Room' before seeing 'The Disaster Artist'? One thing that's not under question is Wiseau's unrelenting drive and energy. That's something plainly obvious in his spectacular Twitter account , which was created around two weeks ago. There's been plenty of excellent, if disconcerting content. May the Good Spirt be with you ! pic.twitter.com/2kv04qrYOM â€” Tommy Wiseau (@TommyWiseau) December 14, 2017 Read more...
