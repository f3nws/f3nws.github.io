Google is at CES in a big way this year -- no, seriously -- and it's mostly centered around one product: Google Assistant . The search giant is incorporating its personal assistant AI into more devices than ever. They run the gamut from smart speakers (some of which have displays), smart earbuds and yes, even cars. If CES 2017 was the Alexa show , then CES 2018 just might very well be the Google show.

"[The third-party devices] go through the same rigorous testing that we do on our own devices," said Chris Turkstra, a director for Google Assistant.
