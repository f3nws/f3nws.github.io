Rez Infinite is a sublime experience in virtual reality, but there's a catch: that requirement for PlayStation VR or a PC usually means you're tied down. That won't be an issue after today, provided you have the right hardware: Enhance Games has released Rez Infinite for Android. You'll need a Daydream-compatible VR headset with a controller (and the phone to match, of course), but you too can soar through virtual worlds and shoot enemies to a trance beat. And yes, the Infinite -only Area X is as visually intense as ever -- modern mobile hardware is clearly up to the job. The game is free to download, but only as a trial. If you want to unlock the full experience, you'll need to pay $10 to unlock the full experience. Let's be honest, though: you probably want to. While Rez has never been a particularly long game (a good player can blast through the core experience in less than an hour), it's both very memorable and has extensive replayability. As it is, this is the most affordable way to play Rez Infinite in VR if you already have an eligible phone -- you don't need to buy a high-end headset (or consider upgrading your PC) just to see why its uniquely music-driven gameplay is so special.
