Yesterday was a historic moment for side-eye — and, you know, the state of Alabama or whatever. Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence, making him Alabama's first Democratic Senator in 25 years . Alongside the newly minted senator was his son, Carson Jones, who is gay. During the swearing in, Carson delivered some seriously harsh side-eye to our infamously anti-gay vice president . SEE ALSO: Outside of a Roy Moore rally, the father of a gay daughter lost to suicide speaks up There will be no chance of probation or parole in Carson Jones' prison of judgment. My 2018 aesthetic will be Carson Jones sideeyeing homophobe Mike Pence while his father, Doug Jones, is sworn into the US Senate. 😏 🏳️‍🌈 pic.twitter.com/l21UJ37Q8p — DCHomos (@DCHomos) January 3, 2018 Read more...
