LG is showcasing its 2018 projector lineup at CES 2018 , and among them is the brand's first 4K UHD projector that doesn't quite look most of its peers. The model (HU80KA) is a compact, upright device that can create a 150-inch screen on your wall. Its portable design was made possible by its mirrorless I-shaped engine, which allows it to do its job whether you simply place it on the floor or carefully hang it from the ceiling. LG says it's a product of the company's engineers challenging themselves to make a 4K projector smaller than others on the market without sacrificing performance. In addition to being LG's first UHD projector, HU80KA is apparently also its brightest yet at 2,500 lumens -- its full HD projectors top out at 2,000. And since resolution isn't everything, the model supports HDR content, as well, to make images more life-like. On the audio side of things, HU80KA comes with two 7W speakers, but it can easily be connected to external speakers or soundbars via optical output, HDMI or Bluetooth. Of course, the only way to know if it can truly deliver is to see it for yourself. Unfortunately, LG still doesn't have pricing and availability info to share with us, but we'll at least be able to check it out for you on the showfloor in Vegas.
