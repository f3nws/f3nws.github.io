Google is celebrating the 66th anniversary of what's considered the first modern recording studio with a Doodle . Back in 1951, a group of composers founded the Studio for Electronic Music as part of the West German Broadcasting radio. It was ran by and hosted a multitude of forward-thinking musicians at the time, including Karlheinz Stockhausen, an electronic music pioneer and one of the most important composers of the 20th-21st centuries.

To pay tribute to the studio's colorful history, Google has switched its usual logo with an image meant to encapsulate the vibrancy of the electronic music genre. Google said in its announcement post: "Until the year 2000, the original studio continued to push the boundaries of electronic music and develop new sounds and ideas. Today's Doodle, by Berlin-based illustrator Henning Wagenbreth, celebrates the diversity of thought and imagination that built this studio and transformed the possibilities of music!"
