OkCupid is facing a lot of backlash for ditching usernames in favor of real names. As TechCrunch noted, its app's Google Play and App Store pages are flooded with one-star reviews posted over the past month, complaining about the features the service has recently changed or killed.

We also have a list of banned words that would not qualify. It's important to clarify that this does not need to be your real/legal name, it can be any name that you want someone to call you. We don't have any plans to bring usernames back. We know some folks don't like that usernames are going away but we get many (thousands!) of messages from folks who say they are offended by some of the usernames people make...or they just have a really really ha...
