Unless you're buying a TV for a very large room, 55 inches is probably the ideal size. It's big enough that you can enjoy that nice ultra high-definition screen from anywhere in the room, but not so big that it looks silly. If you're in the market for a new TV and you agree that 55 inches is ideal, today is your lucky day. Everyone knows Samsung TVs have the best display quality, and one of Samsung's best bang-for-your-buck televisions is on sale on Amazon right now at its lowest price ever. Do yourself a favor and check out the Samsung Electronics UN55MU6300 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV while it's still on sale at Black Friday-level pricing.
