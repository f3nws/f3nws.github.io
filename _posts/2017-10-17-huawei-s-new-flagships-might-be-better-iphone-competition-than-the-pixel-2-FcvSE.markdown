Google just unveiled the first Android devices that will run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. But they’re not going to be the only new Android devices running Google’s latest operating system right out of the box this year. That’s right, the first iPhone “killers” with Oreo on board have been unveiled, and they’re not made by who you might've guessed. Samsung, LG, and HTC are yet to unveil new Oreo hardware, and it’ll be a while until they do — the HTC Pixel 2 and LG Pixel 2 XL don’t count.

Amazingly, both devices are made of glass, but neither model comes with wireless charging support, which is a strange decision from Huawei. Finally, the cheaper model will come with a headphone jack and no water and dust proof certification, while the Pro has no 3.5mm port and gets an IP67.
