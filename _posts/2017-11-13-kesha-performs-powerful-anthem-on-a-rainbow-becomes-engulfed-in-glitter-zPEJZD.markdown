Pop singer Kesha smashed out another powerful performance at the 2017 MTV EMAs on Sunday, bringing cathartic single "Learn to Let Go" to the stage with glitter and rainbows aplenty. Hitting London's SSE Arena Wembley, the highly underestimated singer performed the self-healing anthem from her latest album, Rainbow. A simulated rainbow engulfs Kesha and her dancers, before a bona fide glitter storm erupts. The single, released in July, comes from her first album since the sexual abuse claims and legal ordeal with Sony producer Dr. Luke. "As much as our past creates who we are, we can’t let it define us or hold us back. And especially if you’ve been through something hard, and we all have, you can’t hold on to resentment because it’s like a poison," Kesha wrote of the song in HuffPost . Read more...
