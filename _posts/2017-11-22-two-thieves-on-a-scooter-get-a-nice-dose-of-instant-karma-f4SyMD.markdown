London has a bit of a theft problem . Bag and phone snatchers riding by twos on mopeds and scooters have become more and more common in recent years, and people are starting to get pretty fed up. On Sunday a dashcammer captured a good Samaritan fighting back against a few thieves. In the clip, the car with the camera can be seen following two people on a scooter. They slowly approach a woman on a sidewalk, and manage to take off with her bag.

The thieves did manage to get away, but not with any stolen goods. Read more... More about Viral Videos , Dashcam , Instant Karma , Culture , and Web Culture
