It seems like if there's anywhere to be in the world, it'd be in New Zealand. These holidays, New Zealanders are set to again participate in a nationwide Secret Santa , organised by the country's postal service, NZ Post. SEE ALSO: Want to feel relaxed over the holidays?

For those unfamiliar with the concept, Secret Santa, sometimes called Kris Kringle, is an activity where one person gives a (usually small) gift to another person, but the recipient is not told who it came from. It requires a group of people, and names are drawn at random. New Zealand's nationwide Secret Santa has been going since 2010, but NZ Post took the reins in 2013.
