Google doesn't usually have a big presence at CES, but that's changed in a big way this year. You can't help but notice that the monorail circling the Las Vegas Convention Center bears huge letters saying "Hey Google!" Just below, Google has set up a huge, multi-story monument to the Google Assistant booth in convention center parking lot. It's still under construction so it's hard to say exactly what's going on in there. (Also, there's a superfluous spiraling slide on the side of the booth and a weird Google Assistant ball pit game near the convention center's main entrance.) Even though Google hasn't done much at CES in recent years, it makes sense for it to make a big splash this year. (We've reached out to the company to ask about its showy CES display this year and will update when we hear back.) Earlier this week, the company announced that it has sold "more than one" Google Home device per second since the Home Mini launched in October. That works out to about 6.4 million Home devices in the last few months -- and that's not including the original Home speakers that've been sold since it arrived in the fall of 2016. In fact, Google says it has sold "tens of millions" of Home devices so far. Google doesn't typically release hardware sales numbers, but it's not a stretch to imagine that Google Home is the company's best-selling hardware product ever. And they're also in heated combat with Amazon and Alexa for voice assistant dominance. Amazon is still in the lead, but the low-priced Home Mini has undeniably made the Google Assistant a serious competitor to Alexa -- not to mention the fact that it's baked into most modern Android phones now. With a successful 2017 behind it, Google is using CES to keep the pressure on Amazon going forward. The company probably won't announce new hardware this week; instead, we'll hear about new partnerships with third-party hardware makers. Amazon has been doing that with Alexa for a while now, but it's relatively new territory for the Assistant. Given the huge range of companies here in Vegas, it's a sure bet that many...
