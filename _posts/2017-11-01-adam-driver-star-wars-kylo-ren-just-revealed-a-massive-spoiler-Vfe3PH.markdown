![Adam Driver, Star Wars’ Kylo Ren, just revealed a massive spoiler](https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/star-wars-kylo-ren.jpg?quality=98&strip=all)

We only have to wait about six weeks until the next Star Wars episode will hit theaters. The Last Jedi launches in mid-December, just like The Force Awakens a couple of years ago.

He does feel bad about killing Han Solo though. "“When I watched the premiere, I felt sick to my stomach... Immediately, I thought I was going to puke," he told GQ I was holding my wife [Joanne Tucker]'s hand, and she’s like, ‘You’re really cold. Are you OK?’ Because I just knew what was coming – I kill Harrison Ford – and I didn’t know how this audience of 2,...
