While Google might soon switch VIPs over to advanced protection in the form of physical keys, the rest of us are fine with typical security practices -- so long as we follow them. To better secure your Google account, the company has a new version of its Security Checkup feature that points out vulnerabilities. Instead of needing to run through the same generic checklist of questions, the tool will instead identify weak areas in your account setup and bring them to your attention. None of the security suggestions (removing certain extensions, for example, or enabling 2-step verification) are new, and it still uses green checks marking safe setup and yellow/red checks denoting areas that need fixing. Only the personalized system is new, but hey, any time not spent glossing over what you've already correctly set up is more mental bandwidth to make your account less vulnerable. Visit the Security Checkup page to see the updated version. Via: TechCrunch Source: Google blog
