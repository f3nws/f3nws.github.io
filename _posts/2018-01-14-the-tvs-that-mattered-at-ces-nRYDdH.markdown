As usual, CES 2018 provided a bonanza of big screens, loaded up with every piece of tech you can create a buzzword for.

It's also dug in its heels against Dolby Vision, opting instead to push HDR10+ as a competing standard, adding Warner Bros. as an ally . There's a lot going on here, but it could give Samsung a chance to push its TVs as smarter, cheaper options -- if people appreciate the experience.
