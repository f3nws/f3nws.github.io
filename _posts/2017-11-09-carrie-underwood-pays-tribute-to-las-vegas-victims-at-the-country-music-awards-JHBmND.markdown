Carrie Underwood delivered a moving tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting at this year's Country Music Awards. Underwood was co-hosting the awards on Wednesday night, and took to the stage to perform the song, "Come Home," while images of those killed in the Oct. 1 shooting were shown on screens. The performance followed a few mentions of Las Vegas from Underwood and her co-host Brad Paisley during their monologues, including a jab at the Country Music Association, who controversially warned reporters not to ask about the attack on the red carpet. Nashville singer Jason Aldean, who was performing on stage in Las Vegas at the time of the attack in October, previously performed a tribute to the victims on SNL. Read more...
