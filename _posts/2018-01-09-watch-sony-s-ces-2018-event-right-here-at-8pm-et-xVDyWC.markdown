Sony is about to hold customary CES presentation, and it's giving everyone an opportunity to tune in. The company is livestreaming the event on its website and on Ustream (below) starting at 8PM Eastern. It isn't revealing too much about what you'll see, although it's virtually certain that you'll hear about new Bravia TVs and audio gear . We also wouldn't rule out talk about more adventurous projects like the Aibo revival , for that matter. Sony isn't always daring at CES, but there's usually something to catch your attention.
