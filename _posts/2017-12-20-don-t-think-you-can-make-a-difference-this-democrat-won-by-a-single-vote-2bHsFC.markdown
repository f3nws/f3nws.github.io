Democracy! Sometimes it feels so pointless. But before you decide to skip next election, consider this: a race in the Virginia House of Delegates was decided by a single vote .

SEE ALSO: The most insane White House presser moments of 2017 Yep. One single vote. The dude who sat at home watching Netflix instead of voting probably feels pretty bad right about now.
