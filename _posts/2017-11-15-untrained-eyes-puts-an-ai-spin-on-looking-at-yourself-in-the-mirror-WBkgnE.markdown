What if you stood in front of a mirror and saw someone who barely looked like you? That's exactly what happens in Untrained Eyes , an interactive sculpture debuting today at the Engadget Experience , a one-day event that showcases exhibitions which mix art with technology . Untrained Eyes , created by conceptual artist Glenn Kaino and actor Jesse Williams ( Grey's Anatomy ), doesn't require a headset to be experienced. Instead, the project uses your face, a mirror, a Kinect and machine-learning to show you pictures of people whom you may look like -- or not. Sometimes you won't get a person who resembles you in any way, but that's the entire point of Untrained Eyes . When Kaino and Williams set out to make this project, it was always with the intention to shed light on the inherent flaws of artificial-intelligence algorithms , particularly those used in image-search databases. The experience itself works effortlessly. You walk up to the installation, wave at the mirror and then, within a few seconds, you'll be presented an image of your alleged doppelgÃ¤nger. The images displayed are pulled from a curated dataset that will "match" your appearance, based on your facial attributes. In its current iteration, Untrained Eyes features five mirrors, which wasn't the original idea. Kaino said that, toward the end of the development process, he realized that the installation would be better with more than a single mirror. That way people could see each other's reactions to their image results. And you can definitely see the difference when someone who tries it gets a picture of Brad Pitt, as opposed to another human being who's, well, less attractive. People will keep going back in front of the mirror, waving their hand and waiting until they get an image of someone whom they're satisfied with. An Engadget editor gets an unlikely match. Regardless of the results, Kaino wants Untrained Eyes to make everyone think about the bias of image searches on the internet, be it on Google or other platforms like it. For example, he pointed to the fact that when you search Google...
