Hear a ribbit? There's an app for that. Launched on Nov. 10, FrogID is an iOS and Android app that can identify local frog species by the sound they make. Chirps, ribbits, peeps, whistles, and croaks heard in backyards, creeks and wetlands can be recorded and uploaded to the app. Then, FrogID, currently only available in Australia, can identify the particular frog species you've found while "frogging."
