Google and Amazon are locked in a bitter fight right now , and you're the one losing out. Google is pulling YouTube apps from Amazon's Fire TV streaming sticks and Amazon's Echo Show. Google straight-up admitted this is retaliation: Amazon doesn't allow Google's Chromecast devices to stream Amazon Prime Video, and it doesn't sell Chromecast products, so why should Google put its services on Amazon's platform? What you have is a classic fight for control. Both companies make great streaming services and great streaming devices, and neither company wants to give up either.

The interface feels a little more like cable than a Chromecast, since you use a remote to flick through "channels" and see what's on. Still, it's much better and cheaper than cable, and -- I'm going to keep saying this -- there's no better or cheaper way to stream all the stuff you love. The best part is that since Roku doesn't have a its own major streaming platform li...
