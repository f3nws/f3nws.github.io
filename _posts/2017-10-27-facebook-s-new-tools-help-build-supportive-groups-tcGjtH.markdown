Facebook has been steadily improving things for groups on the social network. The company added administration tools like membership insights for community pages. It also created Groups for Pages to let businesses, artists and brands create their own communities. It also shuttered a standalone Groups app in the hopes of bringing the functionality into the already existing Facebook app. Now the company is adding new features for groups to help build communities, including welcome posts, group-specific badges and member profiles. Group admins will also get new features like expanded insights and tips to help them manage contentious conversations and to know when is the best time to schedule posts. The new tools are all aimed at making Facebook Groups a better place to be. A welcome post helps new members feel valued and appreciated from the first login to a specific community. Badges let you show your support and identify with your favorite community groups, while member profiles could help everyone get to know each other better. "Now, when group members click on another person's name they will be directed to a group-specific profile," Facebook said in a blog post , "based on publicly-available information like things they may share in common and a feed of that person's activity in the group." If you're an admin, Facebook knows it takes time to moderate groups so that everyone feels safe and supported. The new admin-specific tools let moderators remind members of the rules of conduct, temporarily turn off a member's ability to post or comment and even remove members who violate these rules with a click. The new tips can help you figure out when to schedule posts as well as things to add, like location tags, to make your group even more useful to members. "We've learned so much from working with group admins already," said Facebook, "and this is just the beginning. There's a lot more work to be done and we look forward to continue building the tools they need to bring the world closer together." Source: Facebook
