In the meantime, however, Apple offers a workaround that most people seem to be having luck with. All you need to do is configure a new text replacement shortcut. Here are the steps: Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement Tap + In the Phrase field, type an uppercase "I" In the Shortcut field, type a lowercase "i" That should do the trick.
