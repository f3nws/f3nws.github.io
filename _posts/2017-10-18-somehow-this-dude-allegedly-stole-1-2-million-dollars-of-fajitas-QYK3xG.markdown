Stealing a million dollars worth of any food seems like a difficult task in itself. Yet somehow, an employee by the name of Gilberto Escamilla, who works for the Cameron County Juvenile Justice Department in Texas, was alleged to have stolen $1.2 million of fajitas over a nine year period, as reported by the Brownsville Herald .

But this is the real thing," District Attorney Luis V. Saenz told the newspaper. The alleged plot was only uncovered when Escamilla took a day off for a doctor's appointment on Aug. 7.
