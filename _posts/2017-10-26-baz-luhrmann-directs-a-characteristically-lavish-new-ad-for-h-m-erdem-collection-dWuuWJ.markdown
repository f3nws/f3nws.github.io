Academy Award-nominated director Baz Lurhmann created an opulent ad for H&M's new collection with London-based fashion label Erdem, out Nov. 2. Dubbed The Secret Life of Flowers , the short film is set in a grand old country mansion home to folks enjoying an eternal spring. Throw in a love triangle and you've got The Great Gatsby in a high-end florist, set to a new track called "Hypnotised” by British trio Years & Years. "It’s a very modern love story, set in a country house that is full of its own secrets and it’s like a metaphor for our times — it’s harsh out there in the world, but in here, the things that really matter keep growing in an eternal spring," said Luhrmann in a press statement.
