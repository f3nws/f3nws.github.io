Joe Biden teamed up with Lady Gaga to deliver a powerful message about sexual assault: that the responsibility is "on everyone to intervene" when we see or hear about sexual violence. "It's on everyone to intervene to stop abuse when they see it, when they hear about it," said Biden. Lady Gaga added that it's important for survivors of sexual violence to reach out to people they can trust who can be there for them. "I am a sexual assault survivor and I know the effects, the aftermath, the trauma, psychological, physical, mental. It can be terrifying waking up every day feeling unsafe in your own body," she said. Read more... More about Joe Biden , Sexual Assault , Lady Gaga , Sexual Violence , and Social Good
