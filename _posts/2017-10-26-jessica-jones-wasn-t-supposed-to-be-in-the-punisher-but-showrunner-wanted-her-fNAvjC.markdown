Some may have been surprised when Marvel character Jessica Jones was announced to be part of the upcoming Netflix series The Punisher . Showrunner Steve Lightfoot revealed that Jones, played by Krysten Ritter, wasn't initially planned to cross over into the series, but he requested to write her in, because of the chemistry between the two characters. "I asked to have her, because Jessica and Frank [Castle] are so great," he said, during a visit to Singapore.
