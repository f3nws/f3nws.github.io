All of the products we cover here at the BGR Deals team are recommended, but every once in a while we get the opportunity to cover a killer deal on one of our favorite products. Such is the case today, because Amazon just dropped the price of the Shredded Memory Foam Pillow by Comfortac to an all-time low in both queen and king sizes. Getting a good night's sleep is so important, and the quality of the pillow you use plays a bigger role than you think. We spent months trying to find the perfect pillow and we went through more than a dozen different options in the process. This luxurious Comfortac pillow is where we landed, and now you can skip right to it instead of being disappointed a dozen times before you get there. One quick note: MAKE SURE you toss it in the drier for about 15 minutes on low heat before the first time you use it. Trust us. Here are some key details from the product page: TIPS – Before your first use, put the pillow in dryer for 20min to speed up the fluff process right out of vacuum package; the pillow case is totally removable and washable, making accidental messes worry-free EXTRA 20% FILL - add or remove foam to adjust to your comfort; perfect custom-made pillow each time for all sleep positions 100% COTTON REMOVABLE COVER - extra breathable and greater ventilation; gives you a unbeatable clean, crisp feel that you don’t get from polyester INSIDE MATTERS - our certified memory foam is made without TCEP flame retardants or any heavy metals; meets high standards for content, emissions and durability MOLDABLE SHREDDED MEMORY FOAM - provides the plushness, breath-ability and shape-ability of down and the support of memory foam
