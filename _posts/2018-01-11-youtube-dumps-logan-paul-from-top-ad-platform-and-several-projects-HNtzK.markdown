![YouTube dumps Logan Paul from top ad platform and several projects](https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u2mr1QZX2tjLcC3B97Fo_dzaGSo=/1200x630/2018%2F01%2F11%2Fd4%2F6cfc8e49451d41c8b65159f3c1e567c1.aefaf.jpg)

After a flurry of backlash, YouTube has finally taken action against disgraced vlogger Logan Paul . The company announced on Wednesday that it will remove Logan Paul's YouTube channel from Googleâ€™s preferred ad program, which means less ad money in Paul's pocket from his channel with over 15 million subscribers. Additionally, YouTube seems to be cutting as many ties as possible with the vlogger, canning the YouTube Red movie The Thinning: New World Order, which was slated to star Paul. The film was a sequel to the 2016 YouTube Red Movie, The Thinning, according to Polygon . SEE ALSO: Supercut of Logan Paul's Japan visit shows his true colors Read more...
