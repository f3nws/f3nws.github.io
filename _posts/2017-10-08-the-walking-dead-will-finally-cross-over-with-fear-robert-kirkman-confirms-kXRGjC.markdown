Ever since The Walking Dead got its spinoff (aka prequel series) Fear the Walking Dead, fans and reporters alike have been badgering the producers behind the two shows about the possibility of a crossover — and apparently said badgering has finally paid off. "There are two Walking Dead shows, which I'm not gonna name... But there is one character — that I will not name — that is going to go from one show... and appear in the other show," series creator Robert Kirkman revealed at the show's New York Comic Con panel. "What does that mean, because these timelines [are separate]? Will we see an interesting backstory of a Walking Dead character show up in Fear the Walking Dead, or are we going to see a Fear the Walking Dead character show up in the future on Walking Dead ? Is it going to be something completely different than that? I don't know!" Read more... More about The Walking Dead , Amc , Fear The Walking Dead , Robert Kirkman , and The Walking Dead Season 8
