Randi Zuckerberg has alleged that a man seated next to her on a flight sexually harassed her repeatedly. But when she told a flight attendant, her complaint was brushed off. Zuckerberg, CEO of Zuckerberg Media and sister of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, tweeted a letter she sent to Alaska Airlines' CEO Brad Tilden, relating the incident.

The flight attendants told me he was a frequent flier, brushed off his behavior & kept giving him drinks. I guess his $ means more than our safety?
