As the time ticks down until 2018, we have a few new debuts scheduled for this week. Netflix is coming out swinging, with a new season of Black Mirror , season two of its Bill Nye series, the third season of Lovesick (fka Scrotal Recall ) and new comedy specials from Dave Chappelle (Equanimity & The Bird Revelation). The only game release of note is SteamWorld on Switch, while movie fans can pick up an Ultra HD copy of Terminator 2: Judgement Day . Oh, and yes, Netflix does have more New Year's Eve specials that you can play whenever it's time to put the kids to bed.
