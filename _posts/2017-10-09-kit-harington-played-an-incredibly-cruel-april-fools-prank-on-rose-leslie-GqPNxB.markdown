April Fools' Day is still a while away but if you're already planning your next prank, listen and learn. Kit Harington — aka Jon Snow a.k.a soon-to-be husband of Rose Leslie a.k.a Ygritte in Game of Thrones (R.I.P.) — told the Jonathan Ross Show about a particularly cruel April Fools' prank that backfired on him big time. “My family does April Fools'. Her family doesn’t do April Fools'. She didn’t know the date and after that she was in tears. And I was there going, ‘April Fools!’ It didn’t go down well," he said. "She pretty much told me if I did it ever again that would be it and I think that’s marriage included.” Read more...
