Taylor Swift dropped her first video of 2018 and it's a large one. Swift's newest single from 2017's reputation features genuine rapper Future and apparently aspiring rapper Ed Sheeran for the pseudo title track from the album. And yes, Swift raps, too. First teased on her social media app, The Swift Life , and on Instagram by Swift, then previewed on Good Morning America , the video was shot in Tokyo, Miami and London. It was directed by longtime Swift collaborator Joseph Khan, who's responsible for some of the pop star's most well known music videos, including "Blank Space" and "Look What You Made Me Do".
