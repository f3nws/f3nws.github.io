Emma Thompson says Harvey Weinstein should be labelled a "predator" — rather than just a "sex addict" — and that his behaviour is indicative of an "endemic" culture of sexual harassment in Hollywood. Appearing on BBC Newsnight , Thompson said Weinstein is "at the top of the ladder" of a "system of harassment and belittling and bullying and interference and [...] pestering." SEE ALSO: Harvey Weinstein's harassment was an open secret in Hollywood. He's far from alone. The actress noted that one of the big problems in this system is "that there are so many blind eyes" who remained silent about Weinstein's history. "We can’t keep making the women to whom this happens responsible," she said. Read more... More about Uk , Sexual Harassment , Emma Thompson , Harvey Weinstein , and Entertainment
