If you're in the market for a new microSD card, today is your lucky day because Amazon has two great deals you're definitely going to want to check out. The SanDisk Ultra 256GB microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter is down to $123.99 if you're willing to wait a little while for it to ship (of note, the Amazon page says 1-4 weeks but in our experience, things almost always ship out quicker than Amazon says). If you don't want to spend quite that much and you're willing to drop your capacity down to 200GB, the Sandisk Ultra 200GB Micro SDXC UHS-I Card with Adapter has been discounted to $74.50. Here are some highlights from the product page: Ideal for android-based smartphones and tablets Holds up to 24 hours of full HD Video7 A1-rated for better app performance1 Premium transfer speeds of up to 95MB/s** Class 10 for full HD video recording and Playback2
