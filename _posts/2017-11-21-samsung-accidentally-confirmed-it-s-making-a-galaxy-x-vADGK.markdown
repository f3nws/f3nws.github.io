Samsung’s dream is to beat Apple’s iPhone, and that’s why the Galaxy S8’s development codename was “dream.” However, no Galaxy S or Galaxy Note device captured the mind of buyers like the iPhone rival, no matter how hard Samsung tried. But the Korean giant may have an ace up its sleeve, a smartphone unlike anything else available out there, iPhone included. It’s called Galaxy X, but not for the reasons you expect.

All Samsung smartphones get leaked well ahead of their time, as there’s no such thing as keeping a Samsung gadget secret. From the looks of it, however, the phone may be nearing its launch, even if it’ll be a limited one. After all, Samsung isn’t the only company working on foldable smartphones, and it probably ...
