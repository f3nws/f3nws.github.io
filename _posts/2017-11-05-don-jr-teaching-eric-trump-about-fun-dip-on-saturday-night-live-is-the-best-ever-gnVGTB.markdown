There's a lot to like about this Weekend Update sketch on Saturday Night Live , but really, the best of it comes when Mikey Day and Alex Moffat trot out their always-hilarious impressions of Donald Trump's elder sons, Don Jr. and Eric. In related news, Fun Dip is about to be popular again. As funny as the Trump Bros are, don't overlook the real fire in this sketch: Michael Che's searing takedown of President Trump. I'll let the quote speak for itself; it's a good one. "If you want to live-tweet Morning Joe or Cupcake Wars or whatever else you watch, fine. But indictments are important and you work for us â€” so go put on your baggy suit, fold your hair nice, and answer all of our questions face-to-face like the public servant that you are."
