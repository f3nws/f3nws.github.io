Despite Tesla's best efforts, Model 3 deliveries over the past quarter were exceptionally low. Getting down to specifics, Tesla earlier this afternoon posted its earnings report for the third quarter and revealed that it only managed to deliver 222 vehicles to customers over the past few months. As we've covered previously, Tesla is still encountering some production bottlenecks with the Model 3, though Elon Musk has assured the Tesla faithful that things are looking up. All told, it's abundantly clear that Tesla's goal of manufacturing 20,000 Model 3 units per month by December is nothing more than a pipe-dream at this point. Looking ahead, Tesla anticipates that Model 3 production will finally reach 5,000 units per month sometime by the end of March. Regarding the aforementioned production delays, Tesla's earning report notes: To date, our primary production constraint has been in the battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1, where cells are packaged into modules. Four modules are packaged into an aluminum case to form a Model 3 battery pack. The combined complexity of module design and its automated manufacturing process has taken this line longer to ramp than expected. The biggest challenge is that the first two zones of a four zone process, key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers, had to be taken over and significantly redesigned by Tesla. We have redirected our best engineering talent to fine-tune the automated processes and related robotic programming, and we are confident that throughput will increase substantially in upcoming weeks and ultimately be capable of production rates significantly greater than the original specification. As for how Tesla performed otherwise during the quarter, well, that's something of a mixed bag. Despite record revenue to the tune of $2.9 billion, Tesla lost $619 million for the quarter, which translates out to $2.92 per share. As a point of context, analysts on Wall St. were anticipating a strong loss, but more in the range of $2.30 per share. The silver lining, though, is that Tesla ove...
