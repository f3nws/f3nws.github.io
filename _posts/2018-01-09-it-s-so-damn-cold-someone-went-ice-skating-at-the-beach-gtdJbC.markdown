Temperatures dipped so low in Maine this weekend that a man was spotted ice skating — at the beach. Peter and Sandra Lekousi were out for a chilly stroll on Long Sands Beach in York on Sunday when they spotted the odd scene, according to the Boston Globe . The ocean water had froze in such a way that it left a relatively flat and smooth surface for the man to skate on, so that's exactly what he did. “It was freezing cold — too cold for us to be on the beach — and he was skating on the beach,” Sandra told the Globe . Peter later uploaded the clip to his Facebook page, jokingly writing that "every day is a beach day in Maine." Read more... More about Climate , Weather , Winter , Viral Videos , and Ice Skating
