Yes, we're having this discussion. As the fallout over Trump's alleged remark about the U.S. accepting people from "shithole" countries continues, we might be all getting angry about the wrong word. SEE ALSO: How foreign media translated Trump's 'shithole' comment The word uttered, according to a tweet by Washington Post's White House reporter Josh Dawsey, apparently might be "shithouse." White House official told me tonight there is debate internally on whether Trump said "shithole" or "shithouse." Perdue and Cotton seem to have heard latter, this person said, and are using to deny. â€” Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) January 15, 2018 Read more...
