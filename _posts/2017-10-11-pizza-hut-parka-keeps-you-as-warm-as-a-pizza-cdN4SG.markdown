Pizza Hut has a history of weird new "products" that are tragically just concepts announced as a stunt (sorry, no pie-ordering hi-top sneakers for you). As we stare down the barrel of another impending winter, it's only fitting that the 'za king introduces a parka made of the insulating material it knows best: The lining on its delivery pouches. As with all our fast food gear, we have ultra-serious questions about this apparel. Will the iPhone X's Face ID work through the clear smartphone case on the left wrist, ostensibly there to let you order pizza in the cold? For that matter, which of our smart devices can even fit in the triangular pocket on the inside of the parka, save for a pizza-shaped device case ? Und so weiter . Yeah, you'll never get your hands on one, but at least it's not like Pizza Hut's other promotions that only give away zany items outside the US. Not that it's alone in committing this sin, as sister brand KFC is infamous for its non-American stunts . Source: Pizza Hut (YouTube)
