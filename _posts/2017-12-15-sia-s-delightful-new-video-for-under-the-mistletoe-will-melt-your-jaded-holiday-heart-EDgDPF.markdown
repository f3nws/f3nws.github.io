We just finished watching Sia's adorable new video for her holiday single "Under the Mistletoe" and we're a little teary-eyed. Originally released Nov. 17, the lovelorn holiday ballad comes from Sia's first-ever Christmas album, Everyday Is Christmas . Now, the single has a delightful video to match, which reminds us of Raymond Briggs' classic holiday story The Snowman . It follows the tale of a young whippersnapper with a Sia-like fringe, who strikes up a pretty damn magic friendship with a snowman who comes to life. It'll melt your cold, cold, holiday-hating heart.
