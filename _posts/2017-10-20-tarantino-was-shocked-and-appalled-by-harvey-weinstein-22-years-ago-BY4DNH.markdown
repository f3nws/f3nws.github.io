Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino had the goods on Harvey Weinstein decades ago — and could have done more to stop his abusive behavior. That's what Tarantino, one of Weinstein's most frequent directorial collaborators, admitted Thursday in a mea culpa of a New York Times interview . He knew — because his own girlfriend had been abused by him. SEE ALSO: How the 'casting couch' joke helped Hollywood cover up sexual abuse “I chalked it up to a ’50s, ’60s-era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” Tarantino said. “As if that's OK. That’s the egg on my face right now.” Despite having that cartoon stuck in his head, the director also admitted he was "shocked and appalled" when his then girlfriend, the actress Mira Sorvino, told him exactly what she told the New Yorker in an article published last week: that Weinstein had given her an unwanted massage, chased her around a hotel room and shown up at her house after midnight.
