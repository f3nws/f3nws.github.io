It has happened: A single Bitcoin, the same digital cryptocoin that you could've bought for a couple of cents less than a decade ago, is now worth more than $5,000. This isn't the first time Bitcoin crossed this milestone — at some exchanges, it was briefly over $5,000 on Sept. 2 before sharply pulling back that same day. But this time, it broke through with ease — one Bitcoin is currently trading at $5,161, having risen more than 7% in the last 24 hours alone.
