AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), the beloved messaging service that was the first online experience for an entire generation, will finally reach the end of its life later this year. SEE ALSO: How dancing emoji hijacked your job — and why there's no going back The remnants of the once popular chat service will be taken off life support (i.e. AOL parent company Oath will discontinue support) on Dec. 15 . So if you're still using AIM to chat with your friends and make plans to meet up at the local mall, you'd better start looking for an alternative chat service. All good things come to an end. On Dec 15, we'll bid farewell to AIM. Thank you to all our users! #AIMemories https://t.co/b6cjR2tSuU pic.twitter.com/V09Fl7EPMx — AIM (@aim) October 6, 2017 Read more...
