Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission. Anyone who regularly makes their bed has the same struggle: fitted sheets that put us through hell. If you pull it over one corner, it pops off the other. You have to lift the whole mattress to tuck it underneath. And lord forbid that you even shift the wrong way at night, or else the entire sheet comes undone and traps you like a fabric deathtrap of frustration. Luckily, the Kickstarter project Stretto aims to get rid of the hassle that comes from fitted sheets. Stretto is a new type of bed sheet that makes bed changing much less of a chore. Instead of struggling to pull it over your bed, you zip up the bed sheet in seconds. The zipper technique makes sure that your bedding is secure and won't spring off. According to the campaign page , your bed sheets are taut enough that they won't wrinkle and will stay nice and smooth no matter how much you toss and turn. It comes in plenty of different colors to fit your aesthetic. When you need to change your sheets, just zip off the old one and effortlessly zip up the new one. Read more...
