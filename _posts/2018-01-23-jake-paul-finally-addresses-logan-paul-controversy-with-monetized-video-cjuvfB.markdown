After more than three weeks and 20 vlog uploads, YouTuber Jake Paul has finally addressed the controversy surrounding his brother Logan Paul 's suicide video. He did it near the end of a roughly 13-minute video titled: "YouTube, Letâ€™s Talk About Brother Logan Paul." Let's be clear: Jake is using his brother's controversy for clicks here.
