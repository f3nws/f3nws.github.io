I have AirPods, I love my AirPods, and I use my AirPods all the time. But if I'm being honest, Apple's BeatsX Wireless In-Ear Headphones are better earbuds. The cord-free AirPods design is fantastic and the carrying case that charges them ensures that you'll never run out of juice. But it's impossible to keep a good seal with the smooth plastic AirPods tips even if you're just sitting there motionless. Meanwhile, the silicone tips on the BeatsX won't shake loose even while you're working out, and they have the same great sound quality as the AirPods. They're discounted on Amazon right now to their lowest price ever in four different colors, so it's high time you experience BeatsX for yourself. Here's what you need to know from the product page: Connect via Class 1 Bluetooth with your device for wireless listening Up to 8 hours of battery life for when you’re on the go With Fast Fuel, a 5-minute charge gives you 2 hours of playback when battery is low Take calls, control your music and activate Siri with RemoteTalk What's in the Box: Beatsx earphones, eartips with four (4) size options, removable secure-fit wingtips, pocket-sized carrying case, lightning to USB-A charging cable, Quick Start Guide, warranty card
