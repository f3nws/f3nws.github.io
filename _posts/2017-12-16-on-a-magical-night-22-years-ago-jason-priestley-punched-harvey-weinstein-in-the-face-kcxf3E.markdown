Let's give it up for Jason Priestley, the unlikeliest hero man of 2017. The Beverly Hills 90210 heartthrob took to Twitter on Friday with a story about the time he punched disgraced Hollywood power player Harvey Weinstein in the face. It was actor Tara Strong who first hinted at the story, in a response to the revelation that Weinstein had blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino .
