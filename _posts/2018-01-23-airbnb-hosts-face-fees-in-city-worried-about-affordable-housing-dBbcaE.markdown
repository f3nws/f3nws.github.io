Airbnb hosts in Boston could get hit with fees in an effort to combat high rents in popular neighborhoods. On Monday, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced that he had filed a city ordinance to regulate short-term rentals. His plan would charge Airbnb hosts fees for renting out their properties, as well as limit the number of days a unit can be rented out. SEE ALSO: 2 Airbnb hosts could be fined up to $148,000 for illegally renting out their apartments "This ordinance is an important step towards our goal of reducing housing costs by creating disincentives to take units off the market for use as short-term rentals," Mayor Walsh said in a statement . "It also allows for the continued use of short-term rentals in scenarios that are non-disruptive to our neighborhoods and support our tourism industry." Read more...
