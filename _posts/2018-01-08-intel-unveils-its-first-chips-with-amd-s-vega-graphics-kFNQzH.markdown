The fruits of Intel and AMD's unprecedented partnership are finally here. Intel just unveiled its 8th generation Core CPUs with AMD's RX Vega M , bringing together its fastest mobile processors with graphics capabilities that used to required a dedicated GPU. Together, they'll lead to thinner and lighter laptops with decent gaming chops. While we got an overview of the chips back in November, we finally have more details at CES. And, simply put, gamers should be pleased. Fittingly, Intel is plugging AMD's RX Vega M module into the first batch of its high-powered "H-series" 8th generation Core chips. These are the processors that are typically paired with dedicated GPUs, like NVIDIA's GTX 10-series line. Now, for the first time, Intel has a custom all-in-one solution. Intel is offering two variants of AMD's graphics: RX Vega M GL, which is meant for laptops, and GH, which is targeted at small desktop-like devices, such as Intel's new NUC . Naturally, the GL variant has a lower clock speed and less graphics hardware than its more powerful sibling. It runs between 931MHz and 1,011MHz and has 20 compute units, while the GH clocks between 1,063MHz and 1,190MHz has 26 compute units. You'll find the GL variant bundled with Intel's new 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, while the GL will only come with an i7. In laptops with the RX Vega M GL module, you can expect speeds around 1.4x faster than NVIDIA's GTX 1050 while playing Hitman. And with the speedier GH graphics, you'll see performance up to 10 percent faster than NVIDIA's GTX 1060 running on a machine with a 7th generation Core CPU. That basically ensures that, in most modern games, you'll see a smooth 60 frames per second in 1080p with high graphical settings. Those figures would be admirable from larger dedicated GPUs. For something bundled together with a traditional CPU, they're honestly astonishing. Intel Intel crafted a unique custom chip to fit in the RX Vega M. It's wider than the company's typical designs, because it fits in both the 8th generation Core processor, AMD's graphics and it makes r...
