If you're a light reader or you only read while you travel, the entry-level Kindle eReader is perfect for you. It's affordable, the battery life is incredible, and it has enough storage to hold more books than you'll ever need. But if you're a more avid book fan who reads as often as you can, there's a hot new Kindle model that you're going to absolutely love. The All-New Kindle Oasis has a gorgeous high-resolution 7-inch E Ink display with a mind-blowing pixel density of 300 ppi. You've never seen anything like this screen. It's also IPX8-rated, which means it's waterproof. We're not talking splash-proof here... you can grab an oxygen tank and read your book at the bottom of a pool if you want to. The Kindle Oasis is thin and light, it has killer battery life, and it's available right now. Here's what you need to know from the product page: Our largest, highest resolution display— 7” and 300 ppi, reads like real paper without glare, even in bright sunlight. The first waterproof (IPX8) Kindle so you are free to read in even more places. Now with Audible, listen to the world’s largest library of audiobooks. Pair with Bluetooth to take the story with you anytime, anywhere. Thin and light ergonomic design with dedicated page turn buttons and adaptive front light so you can read even more comfortably for hours. Keep reading—a single charge lasts weeks, not hours. Enjoy twice the storage with 8 GB. Or choose 32 GB to hold more magazines, comics, newspapers, and audiobooks. Instant access to new releases and bestsellers, or from over a million titles at $2.99 or less. Prime members read free with unlimited access to over a thousand titles.
