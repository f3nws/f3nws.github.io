When Google brought its Allo chat app to the web, it only supported Chrome . That partly defeats the point of an app-independent client, doesn't it? Thankfully, Google agrees. It just expanded Allo's web support to get it running on Firefox , Opera and iOS devices (including Chrome and Safari). You do have to start by scanning a QR code on the desktop using your phone, which is more than a little unwieldy, but this does mean you don't have to live within Google's software ecosystem just to avoid a native app. No, this probably won't get you to ditch Hangouts or another messaging app, but it does open the door to those who otherwise wouldn't give it a shot.
