While initial pre-orders for the iPhone X are still a week away from opening, some Apple die-hards will be able to get started early. Apple's installment-based Upgrade Program that lets customers get a new phone every year will, just like it did with the launch of the iPhone 8 / 8 Plus , allow members to get their loan paperwork in order starting on Monday. Combined with the recently added mail-in return option for their old iPhones, it should make staying up to date easier than ever, even if it doesn't guarantee that they'll be able to purchase the new OLED-screened device right away . For that, they'll have to stay up until 3 AM ET Friday morning just like everyone else. Via: MacRumors , 9to5Mac Source: Apple
