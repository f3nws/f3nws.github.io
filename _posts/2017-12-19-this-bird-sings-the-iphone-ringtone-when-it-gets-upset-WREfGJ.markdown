A sweet cockatiel knows exactly how to get its owner's attention: imitate an iPhone. Vimeo user Ben Pluimer posted a video to his page on Monday featuring his friend's pet bird perfectly recreating that classic iPhone default ringtone. "When my friend's cockatiel gets upset, it sings an Apple ringtone," he wrote in the clip. According to Pluimer, the bird usually gets upset when its humans are tying their shoes and are getting ready to leave the house. At one point the real Apple ringtone is played immediately after the bird sings. The pitch is pretty spot-on, which must be confusing if you're in the next room and you hear your phone going off only to find a sad bird mimicking the iPhone. Read more...
