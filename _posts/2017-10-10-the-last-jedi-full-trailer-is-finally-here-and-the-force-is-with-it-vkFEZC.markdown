Breathe. Just breathe. The first, full, official trailer for The Last Jedi arrived Monday night — and it's full of the same kind of drop-dead gorgeous visuals we saw in the teaser trailer back in April. The movie picks up exactly where The Force Awakens left off — with Rey (Daisy Ridley) presenting Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) with his lightsaber. In this trailer, we see Luke finally responding to this blast from his past. All signs point to Luke reluctantly training Rey in the Jedi way, despite his declaration in the teaser that "the Jedi must end."
