The interactive experience Your Hands Are Feet is a smorgasbord of feelings. Take the title example. Creators Amelia Winger-Bearskin and Sarah Rothberg wanted to pinpoint the feeling of shoes not fitting quite right. Ill-fitting footwear is not a catastrophe, but a mild annoyance that bugs you throughout the day. You can still get things done, but not as easily. It's as if, in their mind, their hands were feet. If it does not make sense in words, that's OK. The point of their demo -- whose first playable version debuted at the Engadget Experience today -- is that virtual reality can convey this feeling in a way that other media, like text, can't. Earlier in its development, Winger-Bearskin and Rothberg explained how they wanted to find fresh ways to describe nuanced emotions. In Your Hands Are Feet , you select a virtual egg and lob it into a portal to kick off a vignette conveying one such feeling. It's not immediately apparent what you're supposed to do, and that surprise is part of the enjoyment. One scenario places you in a surrealist kitchen -- equipped with a sink, cooker and cactus -- with feet on the ends of your limbs (you can still pick up a phone on the counter). Another surrounds you with hundreds of eyeballs, meant to evoke the sensation of seeing yourself through someone else's eyes. Or, you might end up in a window-cleaning cart with a giant pink razor, dispatched to shave a giant's leg. Lopping off its jet-black cylindrical bristles while in an oversized bathtub in the desert is satisfying, but you can never get a clean shave within the time limit. It's a psychedelic spin on a Sisyphean task that can never be completed. Other interactive metaphors include the feeling of being at "the corner of three corners" (imagining your past and future self) or that "everything has vibes" (touch the environment and your controllers will vibrate). In essence, Your Hands Are Feet is about the subjective ways we see the world. It feels like a disorienting trip into someone else's psychological structures; the weird ways we conceptualize our experiences in o...
