This recap contains spoilers for The Walking Dead Season 8, episode 1, titled "Mercy." The title for The Walking Dead 's Season 8 premiere couldn't be more appropriate; after last season saw our heroes being continually outwitted and oppressed by Negan and his brutal Saviors, this opening hour showed our characters and the audience some mercy, with the forces of Alexandria, Hilltop and the Kingdom banding together to fight back against the bat-wielding bully. The triumphant tone of the premiere fulfilled the promise of the Season 7 finale and leveled the playing field between Rick's posse and the bad guys; ending with the Saviors' base being overrun with walkers and leaving two unlikely characters — Negan and Father Gabriel — trapped in a trailer with no obvious way out. While you might expect Negan to want to kill the preacher outright (or at least use him as a human shield), it sounds like there'll be a little more to their storyline in coming episodes.
