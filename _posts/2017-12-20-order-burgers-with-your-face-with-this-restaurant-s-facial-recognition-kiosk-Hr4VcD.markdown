Why bother trying to describe your perfect, nitpicky burger over the counter when you could just order one with your face? Caliburger launched a new point-of-sale system on Tuesday that lets customers order using facial recognition technology. (This isn't the first time the American fast food chain has gone high tech — it previously welcomed a burger-flipping robot called Flippy. ) The first time customers order using the in-store kiosks, they’ll be prompted to attach their face to their account using NeoFace biometric facial recognition software. Image: caliburger/screenshot By recording your face in the system, you'll be able to automatically bring up a past order next time with a simple face scan, and earn points (or Calicoins) toward free food down the track. You still have to use your credit card for now, but the company hopes to replace this with face-only payment by 2018. Read more...
