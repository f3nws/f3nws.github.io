The corals which adorn Australia's Great Barrier Reef have long been dying off , but researchers have found a way to potentially ease the decline. In the first project of its kind on the Reef, scientists have found a way to accelerate the growth of coral through a technique called larval reseeding.

This larvae is then reintroduced onto the reef in underwater mesh tents. Read more... More about Australia , Science , Global Warming , Climate Change , and Great Barrier Reef
