Pete Souza is back with more Instaburns for Donald Trump, after the latest scary-beyond-all-reason tweet from the president. The former Chief Official White House Photographer during the Obama Administration, Souza has posted two images on Instagram in response to President Trump's boast on Twitter that his "nuclear button" was bigger than the one apparently on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's desk. SEE ALSO: Twitter says Trump's nuclear button tweet doesn't violate its rules against abusive behavior North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J.
