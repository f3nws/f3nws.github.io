A cyclist flipped off the president's motorcade multiple times as it passed her on Saturday in Virginia, departing the Trump National Golf Club. The odds that President Trump will make a statement claiming the middle finger is a sign of great respect have shifted to about 2-to-1.

"POTUSâ€™s motorcade departed the Trump National Golf Club at 3.12pm, passing two pedestrians, one of whom gave a thumbs down sign.
