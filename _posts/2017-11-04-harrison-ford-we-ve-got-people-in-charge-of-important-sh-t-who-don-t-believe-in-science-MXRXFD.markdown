Harrison Ford may be Hollywood's most entertaining grumpy, old man. His penchant for blunt real talk, especially on topics he cares about, is downright refreshing.

The actor used his acceptance speech that night to dish out some pointed criticism of Donald Trump and his misfit team of climate change skeptics. SEE ALSO: Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling can't keep it together in their funniest interview yet "We face an unprecedented moment in this country. Today’s greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire," Ford said (via The Hollywood Reporter ). "It’s that we’ve got people in charge of important shit who don’t believe in science." Read more... More about Science , Donald Trump , Activism , Climate Change , and Scott Pruitt
