Jabra may have just announced its latest totally wireless earbuds at CES, but I got a hold of a pair early and have been using them as primary headphones for about a week. While the $170 Elite 65t that I've been wearing isn't a final model, they still gave me an idea of what to expect when the final version ships next month. Mostly, Jabra proves that you don't need to spend $250 (or more) to get a pair of earbuds that won't get tangled and still sound really good. You won't find any surprises in terms of design here, as the Elite 65t look similar to other totally wireless earbuds. The in-ear units themselves are small enough to sit nicely in the space just outside your ear, so they don't stick out from your head like some others do (looking at you, Bose Soundsport Free ). The Elite 65t also has controls on both earbuds that make adjustments easy and don't require pulling your phone out of your pocket. On the left side are the volume controls while a short press on the right side will play/pause and a long press will summon your virtual assistant of choice.

Of course, the alternative is no on-board controls at all, so I'll take what I can get. Jabra says both software and sound quality are still being tweaked ahead of the official launch, so I won't go into too much detail there. Based on a few days with the Elite 65t though, the final product will sound really good based on the current audio quality. There's not quite the depth of sound I heard on the Soundsport Free currently, but again, that could change. However, the current current audio profile is still very nice. Highs, mids and lows are all well-represented across a range of genres, including bluegrass, hip-hop, metal, electronic and more. These earbuds, even in an unfinished state, sou...
