If you thought The Handmaid's Tale couldn't possibly get any darker or more disturbing than Season 1, allow the first Season 2 trailer to disabuse you of that notion. There's no actual dialogue in the video, just a lot of haunting imagery â€“ of women and men being abused, of the barren Colonies, of a pissed-off June (a.k.a. Offred) looking ready to burn it all down. All of it is set to a creepy slowed-down of Buffalo Springfield, because apparently not even Gilead is immune to that particular trailer trend. The Handmaid's Tale Season 2 premieres April 25. Read more... More about Tv , The Handmaid S Tale , Elisabeth Moss , Entertainment , and Movies Tv Shows
