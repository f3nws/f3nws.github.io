Earth's infamous ozone hole won't fully recover for another half-century, but NASA has its best evidence yet that this massive environmental scar is slowly healing itself. In the early 1980s, scientists discovered that hair sprays, refrigerants, and other chemicals were releasing an ozone-depleting chemical into the air called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. When sunlight hits these airborne chemicals, it unleashes chlorine atoms which destroy ozone molecules. SEE ALSO: This powerful greenhouse gas has been rising sharply for a decade. Now we know why Scientists found this extremely worrisome: High-altitude ozone absorbs harmful radiation from the sun, providing natural protection for our vulnerable skin and eyes. Read more...
