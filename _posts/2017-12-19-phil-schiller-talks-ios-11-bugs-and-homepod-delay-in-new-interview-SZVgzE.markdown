Any new iOS release is bound to have some bugs; it's simply a reality of software development. That said, iOS 11 from the very beginning was deemed to be unusually buggy relative to previous iterations of iOS.

Again, software bugs are inevitable in any system, but the prevalence and significance of the bugs we saw in Apple software over the past few months inevitably led some to wonder if we're starting to see a worrisome degradation in Apple software quality.

Addressing the issue in a new interview with The Telegraph , Apple executive Phil Schiller dismissed the notion that Apple software engineers are getting careless and that Apple software, on the whole, is getting worse. "We just had a bad week," Schiller explained. "A couple of things happened, thatâ€™s all. The team is going to audit the systems and look carefully at the process and do some soul-searching, and...
