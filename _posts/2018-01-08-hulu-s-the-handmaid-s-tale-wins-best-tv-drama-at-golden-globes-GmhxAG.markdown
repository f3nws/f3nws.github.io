Streaming shows are no strangers to picking up Golden Globe awards , and that trend is continuing at the 2018 ceremony . To start, Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale has won awards for both the best TV drama and best TV actress (Elisabeth Moss). The wins weren't completely surprising given the strength of Margaret Atwood's story, Moss' performance and the all-too-timely subject matter, but it's still a significant victory. Not that other services left the Globes empty-handed. Rachel Brosnahan won the best TV actress award for playing the namesake role in Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , for example. We're still waiting on the full list of winners as we write this, but we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon and Netflix scooped up some of the remaining awards. Developing... Never let them grind you down. Congratulations to The #HandmaidsTale cast and crew on your #GoldenGlobes win for Best Drama Series. #Globes75 pic.twitter.com/hqvKtPwQec — The Handmaid's Tale (@HandmaidsOnHulu) January 8, 2018 The spotlight is on #MrsMaisel !
