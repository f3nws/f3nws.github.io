After a few years away Psych is back, with a two-hour movie this week on USA (and it's not the only one returning -- Cash Cab: Celebrity Edition rides again on Discovery). There are also a slew of season and fall finales, including Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Walking Dead, Broad City and Outlander . Movie fans can get the Transformer movies, Men in Black Series or Despicable Me 3 on 4K Blu-ray, while gamers have DLC for Destiny 2 plus LocoRoco 2 Remastered and The Walking Dead Collection . Last but not least, Amazon kicks off season two of not- Top Gear aka The Grand Tour, while Netflix has season two of The Crown .
