It feels unreal, but it's really happening. The iPhone X is now available for pre-order. After years of constant rumors — intensified at the very last moment as it became uncertain whether the iPhone X will have a Touch ID or not — Apple's radically redesigned iPhone can actually be bought, starting at $999.

Stores are a bit of a gamble, but with a pre-order, you'll at least make sure you'll get a unit in a reasonable amount of time. But you should probably hurry, as rumors say the supply will be extremely limited at first. Read more... More about Apple , Iphone , Pre Orders , Iphone X , and Tech
