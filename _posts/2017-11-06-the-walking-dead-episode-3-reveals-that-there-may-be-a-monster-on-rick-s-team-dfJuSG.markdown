This recap contains spoilers for The Walking Dead Season 8, episode 3, "Monsters." To refresh your memory of where we left off, check out our episode 2 recap . Last week's Walking Dead reintroduced Morales, a survivor we hadn't seen since the early days of Season 1, who has now, much to Rick's horror, joined forces with Negan after losing his family (and his will to live). Episode 3 featured several morality plays, especially in regards to how Rick deals with the Saviors — last week, he inadvertently killed the father of a baby girl, and this week, Morales challenged him to recognize how similar they were — both men defined by their circumstances, but no better or worse than each other, just because one of them happened to be holding a gun. Rick was trying to get through to Morales when Daryl snuck up and shot him from behind, something that seemed to shake our fearless leader — and later we saw Daryl go back on Rick's word and kill another Savior after Rick had promised him mercy.
