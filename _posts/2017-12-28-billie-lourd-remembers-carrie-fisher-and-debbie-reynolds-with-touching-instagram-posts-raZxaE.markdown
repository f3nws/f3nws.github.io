To mark the one-year anniversary of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds ' death, Billie Lourd paid tribute to her mother and grandmother by sharing two touching posts on Instagram. The 25-year-old actress shared two photos of herself standing in front of the Northern Lights in Norway in honor of Fisher, explaining the significance behind her trip. "My momby had an otherworldly obsession with the northern lights, but I never got to see them with her," Lourd wrote. "We journeyed to northern Norway to see if we might 'see the heavens lift up her dark skirts and flash her dazzling privates across [our] unworthy irises.' And she did. I love you times infinity."
