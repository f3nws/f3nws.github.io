Microsoft is now hard at work on its next major update for Windows 10, codenamed Redstone 4 and scheduled for launch in Spring 2018. Here are all the changes coming in this release. Windows 10 Redstone 4 is now in full-time development at Microsoft, and there's plenty of new features and functions planned to be excited about. We're just at the beginning of the Redstone 4 development cycle, meaning we're going to continue updating this changelog every week until Redstone 4 is done. Keep in mind this changelog only includes things that result in new features or big changes. We are not including a list of fixes in this changelog. For that, you can check out the official Windows Blog....
