"I saw him coming over and I was shooting away. The next thing I know his foot connects with my camera and my camera connects with my face, really hard," she said. "He looked straight at me, swung his leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face. He continued performing. I was startled. I kind of stopped looking at him. I just got down and was holding my face because it hurt so badly." Read more... More about Entertainment , Music , Kroq , Queens Of The Stone Age , and Josh Homme
