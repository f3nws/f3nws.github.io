Tesla dropped an electric semi truck and a new Roadster at a recent event, but it apparently launched another product that didn't get any stage time. The automaker has released, of all things, an external battery pack (the Powerbank ) with USB, microUSB and Apple lightning connections that can charge your Android phone or iPhone on the go. Maybe that's not as strange as it sounds, considering Tesla has a Gigafactory that pumps out batteries, including one for homes called Powerwall . In fact, the Powerbank uses a single 18650 cell with 3,350mAh capacity that's also found in its Model S and X electric vehicles. (Obviously, though, the cars are powered by more than one cell.) But you likely wouldn't buy a $45 battery pack with those specs if it weren't designed by Tesla when there are numerous cheaper alternatives. That's probably why the company made sure it looks like a Tesla product through and through. It was designed after Tesla Design Studio's Supercharger monument and wouldn't look out of place inside one of the EV-maker's cars. Unfortunately, you can't get one anymore, no matter how much you're willing and able to shell out $45 for the portable battery: it's already marked sold out on the company's website. You'll just have to cross your fingers and hope Elon Musk and his team decide to produce another batch. Via: 9to5mac Source: Tesla
