Remember when new higher-capacity memory cards used to be released and their prices would be through the roof for months before starting to drop? Well those days are long gone, thankfully. The recently announced Sandisk Ultra 400GB Micro SDXC UHS-I Card is currently the highest-capacity microSD card on the planet, and it costs way less than you’d think. In fact, it only costs $50 more than the retail price of SanDisk’s 256GB card! If you need some serious storage for your camera or mobile device, this is as good as it gets. Here are the key details from the product page: * Up to 400GB to store even more hours of Full HD video7 * Class 10 for Full HD video recording and playback2 * Up to 100MB/s transfer speeds let you move up to 1200 photos in a minute6 * Load apps faster with A1-rated performance1. Durability-shockproof, temperature extremes, waterproof, x-ray proof * Ideal for Android smartphones and tablets, and MIL cameras If you still can’t stomach the 400GB card even at this price, you’ll be happy to learn that the 256GB SanDisk microSD card is discounted right now on Amazon.
