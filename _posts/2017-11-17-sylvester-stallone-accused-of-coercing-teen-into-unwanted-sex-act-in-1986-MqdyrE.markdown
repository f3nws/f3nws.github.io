Sylvester Stallone was accused in 1986 of coercing a woman into a threesome with his bodyguard at a Las Vegas hotel room where she had arrived at the Rocky star's invitation, according to a police report that never resulted in criminal charges. The account, never before been made public, surfaced Thursday in the Daily Mail . The woman was 16 at the time, which the police report states she had disclosed to Stallone and is the age of consent in Nevada. Michelle Bega, spokeswoman for Stallone, shared this statement with us: "This is a ridiculous, categorically false story. No one was ever aware of this story until it was published today, including Mr. Stallone.Â At no time was Mr. Stallone ever contacted by any authorities or anyone else regarding this matter."
