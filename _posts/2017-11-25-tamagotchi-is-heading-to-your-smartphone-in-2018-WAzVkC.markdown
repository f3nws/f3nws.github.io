Tamagotchi is celebrating its 20th birthday this year with the release of a special anniversary edition , which was good enough to land on our holiday gift guide . But, the festivities don't end there, as the virtual pet is (at long last) making the leap to smartphones in 2018. My Tamagotchi Forever for iOS and Android gives the pixellated blob with a face a much-needed makeover. The game is set in colorful "Tamatown," home to other cutesy inhabitants that you can make friends with -- much like Nintendo's latest mobile offering, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp . As usual, your job will be to ensure that the Tamagotchi gets fed, bathed, cleaned, and put to bed on time. And, you can expect to get pinged on your mobile every time the doe-eyed critter wants attention, making neglecting it that much harder. Stop catering to its every need and you could wind up with a sulky ogre. Meanwhile, mini games will earn you coins that unlock items, such as food, costumes, and decorations. Or, you could skip the hard work and fork out real cash for goodies. The game is already available in Canada, according to Touch Arcade , while the rest of us will have to wait for a global release.
