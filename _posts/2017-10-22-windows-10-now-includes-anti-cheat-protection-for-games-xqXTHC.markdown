Windows 10's Fall Creators Update is full of changes, but one of the understated additions could make a big difference if you're a gamer. Microsoft has switched on its previously teased TruePlay feature, which promises to protect against "common" cheats in Universal Windows Platform games. Titles that take advantage of the safeguard will both run in a protected mode and trigger a background service that watches for typical cheating behavior. If they find anything amiss, they'll send data to the developer. You can switch off TruePlay if you're nervous about Windows transmitting your data , but companies can limit what you're allowed to do (playing online, for example) if you don't have it enabled. Of course, the dependence on UWP limits its usefuless. You're more likely to see Valve Anti-Cheat because of Steam's sheer dominance in the gaming world. Consider this, though: TruePlay plugs a hole in anti-cheat protection, and it helps put UWP games more on par with their Steam counterparts. A developer might be more likely to write a UWP version of a title knowing that a few bad apples won't ruin the online experience for honest players.
