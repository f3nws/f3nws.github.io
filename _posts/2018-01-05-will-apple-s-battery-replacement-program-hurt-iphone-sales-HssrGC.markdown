From a certain vantage point, Apple's "batterygate" saga was the scandal that wasn't. Though Apple was deservedly and widely criticized for being less than transparent about throttling CPU performance on older iPhone models with degraded batteries, the company was quick to issue an appropriate and well-crafted response. In addition to issuing an apology and promising to be more transparent about the issue in future iOS updates, Apple, more importantly, lowered the price on out-of-warranty battery replacements from $79 to $29 . In turn, what could have easily been a huge PR crisis for the company has arguably blown over relatively quickly. Of course, Apple also benefited from the timing of the saga insofar that the story was brought to light during the holiday season.

"This means around 16M iPhone sales could be at risk, creating ~4% downside to our current revenue estimate for C2018." Though Apple is still generating some revenue via the $29 fee, it's obviously not anywhere close to the margins Apple enjoys on a brand new iPhone sale. So is Moskowitz onto something here? Truthfully, it's hard to say. While his reasoning makes sense, who's to say what percentage of eligible iPhone ow...
