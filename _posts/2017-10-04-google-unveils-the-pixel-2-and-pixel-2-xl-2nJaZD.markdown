Google has announced the second generation of its venerated Pixel handsets , the Pixel 2 and its larger sibling, the Pixel 2 XL. Rather than attempting to compete on specifications, the company is hoping that its software know-how and a refined design will woo customers. The headline feature, perhaps, is that the Pixels will abandon the 3.5mm headphone jack on its smartphones. Instead, users will need to connect their analog headphones using the bundled 3.5mm USB-C adapter.

As for specifications, the Pixel 2 is packing a 5-inch AMOLED screen with a FHD resolution (1,920 x 1,080) while the XL is packing a 6-inch QHD+ pOLED display (2,880 x 1,440). Inside you'll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 paired with 4GB RAM and either 64 or 128GB of storage. The smaller handset is packing a 2,700mAh battery while the larger has a whopping 3,520mAh cell. Both displays are protected from the elements with a slice of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. As f...
