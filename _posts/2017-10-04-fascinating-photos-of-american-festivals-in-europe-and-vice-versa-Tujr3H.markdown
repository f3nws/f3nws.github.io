Naomi Harris' project EUSA brings us into a surreal cultural phenomena: hyper American-themed places in Europe and hyper European-themed places in America. She is running a Kickstarter campaign to help offset costs for publishing the book. It will feature 134 beautifully printed images and is designed by award-winning Dutch designer Teun van der Heijden. The project features images of Civil War reenactments staged in the Czech Republic, the Dutch-style Tulip Festival in Iowa, a Norwegian festival in Alaska, and many more events on each side of the Atlantic. Between 2008 to 2015, Harris traveled to over 25 locations in the U.S. and Europe documenting people's fascination with an idealized version of each other's culture. Read more...
