Developing new synthetic materials, allowing for faster machine learning, and providing an advanced back-end to power consumer apps. These are just some of the potential applications of the first ever 50-qubit quantum computer prototype displayed at this year's CES conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tucked away in an exhibition room at The Venetian hotel and casino, the unit looked more work of art than state of art, but Vice President and Lab Director of the IBM Research Lab at Almaden Jeff Welser assured us that we were indeed face-to-face with the future of computing.
