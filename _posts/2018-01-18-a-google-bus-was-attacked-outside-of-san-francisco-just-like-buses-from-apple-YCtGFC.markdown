Apple shuttles aren't the only tech buses under attack . Google buses, which carry employees of the tech giant to and from its Mountain View headquarters, are in the spotlight today following an attack on one of the company's chartered shuttles. SEE ALSO: Someone is attacking Apple buses outside of San Francisco California Highway Patrol officer Art Montiel confirmed to Mashable that, in addition to four Apple buses , a shuttle bus chartered by Google was hit in some sort of attack that took place on Highway 280 outside of San Francisco.
