The only time most of us will take on Whitney Houston's iconic song, "I Will Always Love You," is at karaoke or in your own personal shower time. But undeniably accomplished singer Christina Aguilera took on the task in front of millions of people, at this year's American Music Awards. People noted that Nov. 25, 1992 marks the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard , starring Houston. "I Will Always Love You" featured on the soundtrack, which is still the best-selling soundtrack of all time. With a moving introduction from Oscar-winner actor Viola Davis, the awards paid tribute to the film and Houston, who passed away in 2012.
