Tennis star Serena Williams and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian tied the knot at a private wedding ceremony at the Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans on Thursday. The intimate and star-studded event was apparently Beauty and the Beast themed, with major names like Beyonce, Jay-Z, Kim Kardashian West, and Anna Wintour in attendance.
