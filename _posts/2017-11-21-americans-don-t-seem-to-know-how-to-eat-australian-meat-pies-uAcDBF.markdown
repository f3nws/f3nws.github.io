While sinking your teeth into a hot dog at the game is a tradition as old as the hills, Australians prefer to tuck into a meat pie while watching sport. For those yet to try one, the Australian version of the meat pie is a buttery, flaky pie crust filled with beef and gravy that can be held with one hand.

SEE ALSO: Several NBA teams are officially on board for 'League of Legends' franchises The Philadelphia 76ers have signed a partnership with Four'N Twenty pies, which will allow the piemaker to sell its food at Wells Fargo Center's concession stands in the 2017-18 season.
