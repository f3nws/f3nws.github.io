Broadchurch star Olivia Coleman will take over the role of Queen Elizabeth II in the hit Netflix drama The Crown as of Season 3, Mashable has confirmed. Netflix had long intended to pick a different actress to succeed Claire Foy, who played the queen in the 1950s, the early years of her reign. Putting Coleman in the role for Seasons 3 and 4 allows the showrunners to skip forward in time at least a decade. (Foy is 33, Coleman 43.)

It turned out that Broadchurch co-star Jodie Whittaker got that gig , but regenerating into the queen — on the most expensive TV show yet made — is a heck of a good consolation prize for Coleman.
