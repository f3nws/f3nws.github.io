A record 262 journalists were jailed in 2017 simply for doing their work, according to a report published Wednesday by the Committee to Project Journalists. That figure is higher even than last year's historic peak of some 259 journalists behind bars. The nonprofit's annual census found that, of those arrested, an astonishing 21 were arrested on "false news" charges. Others have been jailed for vague "anti-state" charges. In an era of regular "fake news" accusations from Donald Trump, many have pointed a finger at the president for exacerbating the situation.
