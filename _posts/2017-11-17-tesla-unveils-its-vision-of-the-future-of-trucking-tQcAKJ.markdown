At an event adjacent to Space X, the Tesla Semi (yes, that's its name) electric truck was introduced with the same pomp and circumstance the company uses for all its automobile launches. The tall, slick big rig follows the Tesla minimalist design language. The only protrusions are the side mirrors and a sensor array that resemble tiny wings situated at the top rear on either side of the truck. It looks like the future. CEO Elon Musk says it's "designed like a bullet." The Tesla Semi is exactly what you would expect from the company. An electric truck with a 500-mile range and a wealth of technology including Enhanced Autopilot. It also has a plethora of big rig-specific features like jackknifing prevention, sensors for blind-spot detection and data-logging for fleet management. But Tesla is no longer alone when it comes to electric vehicle announcements. Daimler , Cummins , and Toyota (the latter via hydrogen fuel-cells) all have prototype trucks that rely on electrons instead of gasoline for power. Meanwhile, Volvo showed off a hybrid semi-truck earlier this year. Other than Toyota -- which is already moving cargo in Los Angele s -- these trucks probably won't be on the road for a few years. Tesla announced that it'll go into production in 2019. Tesla is also setting its truck apart from rivals by promising a recharge rate of 400 miles in 30 minutes via its new Megachargers. The Tesla Semi will travel up to 500 miles between recharging stops. In contrast Daimler's E-Fuso Vision One can cover up to 220 miles before it needs to stop. Musk said, "you can travel anywhere in the world via the Megachargers." They will be powered by solar panels and like the Supercharger network, will be built by Tesla. While passenger EVs are the main focus of most automakers, electrifying semi-trucks would go a long way to reducing pollution. According to the American Truck Association in 2014, trucks traveled 279.1 billion miles . In 2015, the EPA, noted that medium and heavy-duty trucks accounted for 23 percent of vehicle emissions . The Semi will have Enhanced Autopilot (aut...
