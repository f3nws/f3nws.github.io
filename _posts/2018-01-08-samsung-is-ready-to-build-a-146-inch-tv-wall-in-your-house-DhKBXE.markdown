Last year Samsung announced a 34-foot 4K LED TV that could challenge movie theater screens , and now it's ready to sell a version for home use. The Wall by Samsung uses similar MicroLED tech that is "self emitting" (read: each pixel works without a backlight) and can be assembled in extremely large sizes thanks to its modular design. We don't have much information to go on yet, but the 146-inch 4K screen we saw promises "outstanding brightness, contrast, and close-to- perfect viewing from any angle." Just something to think about, if an 85-inch 8K TV isn't big enough and projector screens aren't bright enough. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2018.
