"Girls" creator Lena Dunham and her co-producer and writer Jenni Konner have defended a writer from the HBO show who was accused of raping a 17-year-old actress. He was 35 at the time of the alleged assault. The allegations against writer Murray Miller, now 40, were reported Friday by The Wrap . Actress Aurora Perrineau, currently 23, filed a police report earlier this year claiming he raped her in 2012 after a drunken night out. Dunham and Konner sent a statement late Friday to The Hollywood Reporter , essentially calling Perrineau a liar. "While our first instinct is to listen to every woman’s story, our insider knowledge of Murray’s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year," they wrote. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center , the rate of false reporting for sexual assault ranges from 2 percent to 8 percent. Read more...
