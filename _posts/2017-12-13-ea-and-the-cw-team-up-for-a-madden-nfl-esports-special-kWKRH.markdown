Sure, Madden NFL is a massively popular video game series that began in 1993 as John Madden Football , but it has never really broken through to the mainstream. The franchise has been making inroads to the eSports space over the last couple of years, though, with a live broadcast last year on ESPN 2. Now the CW is set to air a one-hour primetime special, co-produced by EA and NFL Films called the EA Madden NFL 18 Challenge . The mouthful of a title will air December 27th of this year. According to Variety , the special will focus on eight eSPorts players participating in the Madden NFL competition in LA, with a reality TV show style, like Survivor . That way, you won't have to sit through an entire hour of play-by-play game footage, thank heavens. The actual 2018 Madden Challenge will take place December 18th through 22nd on various livestream platforms, says Variety , which enables the producers edit the footage for the final show. "Television is a very different audience and medium than our digital channels," said EA's Todd Sitrin in a statement. "In the past we've always presented eSports a traditional sporting event, but on TV we really need to move toward an entertainment focus â€“ to highlight the players, who are the real stars."
