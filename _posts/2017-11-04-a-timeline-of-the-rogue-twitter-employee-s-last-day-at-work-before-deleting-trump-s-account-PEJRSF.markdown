This post is a part of Mashable Humor. It is not real. We drew the bird, though, and think it's pretty good. A Twitter customer support employee is responsible for temporarily deactivating the account of President Trump for 11 minutes on Thursday night, just before 7:00 p.m. EST. According to a statement from the company, it was said employee's last day, and they acted without the approval of anyone else at Twitter.
