In Paris, the Seine is flooding. After heavy rains, the river's water level hit around 16 feet on Tuesday, a city official told The Washington Post . It could reach 19.5 feet by the end of the week. On a normal day, it's about 6.5 feet. River cruises and the commuter rail line that runs along the Seine have been shut down. It's the worst flooding since 2016, when rising waters forced the Louvre to shut down as museum workers crated works of art and moved them upstairs. The flood emergency level is currently at "orange," the highest warning below "red." It's not quite the worst flooding Paris has even seen. Back in 1910, the Seine rose to 28 feet, submerging the City of Lights for two months. Read more... More about Paris , Flood , Flooding , Seine River , and Seine
