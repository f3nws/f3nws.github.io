PBS is cutting Sen. Al Franken from their broadcast of the Kennedy Center's ceremony for Late Show host David Letterman, reports The Wrap . Franken, a Saturday Night Live alumni, had given a speech in Letterman's honor at the Mark Twain Prize ceremony on Oct. 23 in Washington D.C. As of Nov. 17, Franken is facing allegations of sexual misconduct from news anchor Leeann Tweeden, who said Franken kissed her without consent and groped her while she was asleep in 2006.
