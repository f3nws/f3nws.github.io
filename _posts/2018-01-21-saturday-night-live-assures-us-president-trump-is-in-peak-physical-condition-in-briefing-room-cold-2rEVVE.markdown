One of the easiest ways for Saturday Night Live to cover a week of news out of the Oval Office – when you don't have Alec Baldwin at your disposal – is to toss Aidy Bryant as Sarah Huckabee Sanders in front of the White House Press Briefing podium. On a day that marks one year in office for President Trump, the anniversary of Women's Marches across the country, and the first time the government has shut down since 2013, Bryant had a lot on her hands. "I'd like to wish everybody a happy Women's March – a million women out there to celebrate the President's first kick-ass year in office," Bryant as Sanders opens, echoing President Trump's real life tweet praising today's demonstrations and congratulating himself for low unemployment among women. Bryant runs over a few "Schumer Shutdown" talking points before giving the stage to Dr. Ronny Jackson (Beck Bennett) to deliver the president's "unbiased, 100% accurate health assessment," rife with words like "young," "svelte," and "gorgeous," which, of course, are unbiased and one-hundred percent accurate.
