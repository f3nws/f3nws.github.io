Bruno Mars and Cardi B have teamed up for a '90s-inspired video for their rework of R&B track "Finesse," from Mars' 2016 album, 24K Magic . While the track was teased with artwork and images on social media as a plain and simple single release, the pair dropped a video at midnight on Wednesday as well. With Cardi B added on vocals, the clip appears to pay tribute to iconic Wayans brothers '90s television show In Living Color , with those classic outfits and signature choreographed dance moves. The sketch show appears to be, according to Mars , one of his "favorite T.V shows of all time." Read more... More about Entertainment , Music , Video , Bruno Mars , and Music Video
