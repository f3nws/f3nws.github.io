We're on the ground in bright and dry Las Vegas for CES 2018 and ready to get this party started. We'll be stuffing your eyes and ears with all the latest news from the world's biggest tech conference this week. Google is already the talk of the show, but it won't be hosting a press event of its own (at least not this year). But there are still plenty of big name companies taking the stage to tell you about their latest gadgets. We'll definitely see tons of laptops and TVs for sure. But don't be surprised if there's a few oddball smart home products and more than few car-related announcements. Of course, we'll be covering the big press conferences live. So make to come back for all our liveblogs starting bright and early Monday morning. Check out the full liveblog schedule below. Monday 1/8 LG : 11am ET / 8am PT HTC : 4pm ET / 1pm PT Samsung : 5pm ET / 2pm PT Sony : 8pm ET / 5pm PT Intel : 9:30pm ET / 6:30pm PT Tuesday 1/9 Ford : 11:30am ET / 8:30am PT Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2018.
