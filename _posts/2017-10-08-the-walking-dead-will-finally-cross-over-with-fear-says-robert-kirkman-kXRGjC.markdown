Ever since The Walking Dead got its spinoff (aka prequel) series, Fear the Walking Dead, fans and reporters alike have been badgering the producers behind the two shows about the possibility of a crossover â€” and apparently said badgering has finally paid off. "There are two Walking Dead shows, I'm not gonna name them... There is one character that is going to go from one show, that I will not name... and appear in the other show, which I will not name," series creator Robert Kirkman revealed at the show's New York Comic Con panel. "So what does that mean, because these timelines, how does that work? Are we going to see an interesting backstory of a Walking Dead character showing up in Fear the Walking Dead, or are we going to see a Fear the Walking Dead character show up in The Walking Dead, and see a future version of a character? What's gonna happen? Is it going to be something completely different than that? Who knows?" Read more...
