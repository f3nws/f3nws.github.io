With the iPhone X release just a few weeks away, many analysts and tech observers are confident that Apple's next-gen iPhone will kickstart one of the biggest iPhone refresh cycles we've ever seen. And with good reason, the iPhone X represents the first major redesign to the iPhone form factor in more than three years. Consequently, the idea that the iPhone X will be a monumental success has almost come to be accepted as irrefutable fact.

Scribner tagged a price target of $140 onto Apple shares, which is to say she sees shares of Apple dropping by about 10% in the near future. All that said, it will be extremely interesting to see how iPhone X sales shake out. While there are undoubtedly many iPhone owners eager to upgrade as soon as they can, there are a few things to keep in mind. For starters, it remains to be seen how long it takes Apple to ramp up supply to meet demand. Second, it remains to be seen if the allure of an edgeless iPhone can offset any p...
