You don't have to keep it a secret anymore; we know you've been yearning for a GoPro ever since you saw that insane first-person POV skydiving video a few years ago. But is a GoPro worth the investment when the most exciting POV videos you could make on a daily basis are you drinking a beer in the shower? (We get it, you like IPAs.) Thankfully, the Activeon CX 1080p WiFi Action Camera is a much more affordable action camera. The camera, which has a built-in battery, simple two-button control, and four fields-of-vision also features advanced components that allow you to record 1080p HD video at 30fps. You can even take time-lapse photos and videos and upload them directly to Instagram with Activeon's built-in WiFi system and video recording app. The camera's 5M Pixel CMOS sensor and F/2.0 lens will capture anything and everything, from the exciting outdoor adventure selfies to the mundane home videos.
