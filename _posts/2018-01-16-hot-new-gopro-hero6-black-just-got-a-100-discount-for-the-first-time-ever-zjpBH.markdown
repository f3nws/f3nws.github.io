Action cameras are a dime a dozen these days, which is great news for people with basic needs. After all, you can get a best-selling 4K action cam on Amazon these days for just $50 . But there's still nothing on the market quite like a GoPro, and the latest professional-grade action camera from GoPro was just discounted on Amazon for the first time since it was released. The GoPro HERO6 Black has a full retail price of $499, and we've seen it on other sites in the $450 range. Right now on Amazon, however, you can grab one for just $399. Here are the highlights from the product page: HERO6 Black automatically sends your footage to your phone where the app turns it into a QuikStory-an awesome edited video. With 4K60 and 1080p240 video,HERO6 Black delivers 2x the performance compared to HERO5 Black. With an all-new GP1 chip optimized for GoPro capture, HERO6 Black delivers vastly improved image quality. With our most advanced video stabilization yet, HERO6 Black captures super smooth footage, whether itâ€™s handheld or mounted to your gear. HERO6 Black is waterproof to 33ft (10m) without a housing. Now featuring touch zoom and an updated UI, the 2-inch display makes it easy to frame shots, change settings and play back footage. Featuring 5GHz Wi-Fi, you can copy photos and videos over to your phone 3x faster than with HERO5 Black.
