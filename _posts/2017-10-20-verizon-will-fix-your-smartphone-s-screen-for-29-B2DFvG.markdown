It happens to the best of us. You buy a new mobile phone, you get a case, you try to be extra careful, but you drop it. Cracked screens happen often enough that most major carriers and device manufacturers have a separate section in their mobile protection plans just for replacing a broken display. According to a report on Phandroid , Verizon has just added the repair type to it's own mobile insurance plans with an affordable $30 deductible, down $20 from the previous $50 amount. Verizon's Total Mobile Protection Plan will run you $11 per month for a smartphone, $9 per month for a basic phone or tablet, and you can pay $33 per month to insure multiple devices. If you crack your screen, says Verizon, you may be able to get it repaired that same day, provided you live in "select markets" and have "certain devices." The company also says a technician can meet you at your home, office, school or wherever you are while traveling. Verizon isn't the only carrier with this sort of plan. AT&T has three plans for $9, $12 or $35 a month each of which includes potential same-day cracked screen repair, though the deductible here is $90. Sprint 's Total Equipment Protection plan has five tiers (starting at $9 per month), which also includes cracked screen repairs for a variable rate, $50 for Tier one customers and $100 for Tier two folks. Apple Care Plus gets you an iPhone screen repair for $30, which is now a $170 service if you didn't purchase Apple's extended warranty plan. Complicated? Yes. Useful? Probably. Source: Phandroid
