In the New York Times, actress Mayim Bialik weighed in on the Harvey Weinstein saga by detailing her own experience with the culture of Hollywood — one that differs from that of many of her peers. It's okay that Bialik's experience is unique. Every woman's is, and valid to boot. What's not okay is Bialik's fundamental misunderstanding of how harassment works — a misunderstanding that makes the piece careen into victim-blaming territory. SEE ALSO: This New York Times comment perfectly explains why women didn't speak up about Harvey Weinstein "I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise," Bialik writes. "I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy." Read more...
