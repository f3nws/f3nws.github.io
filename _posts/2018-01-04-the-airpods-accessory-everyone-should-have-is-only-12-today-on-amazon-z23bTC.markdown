We love so many things about Apple’s AirPods, from the design and sound quality to the battery life. There are also some things we don’t like at all about the AirPods, and the smooth plastic tips are at the top of the list. Whether you’re in the middle of an intense workout or just sitting still in a chair, the plastic tips slowly slide and prevent the AirPods from maintaining a seal in the wearer’s ear canal, which means there’s no noise isolation. Luckily, there’s a simple fix that only costs $12. Check out the EarBuddyz 2.0 Apple Airpods Covers on Amazon, which will keep your AirPods snug as a bug in a rug… in your ears.
