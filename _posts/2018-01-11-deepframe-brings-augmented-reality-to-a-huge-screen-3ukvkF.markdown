It's easy to feel a bit disillusioned with all of the hype around augmented reality. We've seen basic examples of AR take off, with apps like Pokemon Go , but that's not exactly immersive. AR glasses, meanwhile, are still finding their legs. But Realfiction believes there's another approach: Its large 64-inch screen called Deepframe. It basically takes the AR experience we've seen from things like Meta's glasses , and transforms it into something that a whole crowd of people can see. While it's not something you'd ever get at home, it could change the way we interact with stores and museums. Like other AR solutions, Deepframe relies on optics for its magic. It actually reflects the output from a display in front of it -- in my demo, it was from a 65-inch 4K OLED. The Deepframe itself doesn't have any electronics. With this setup, you'll be able to scale the resolution of what the screen shows just by upgrading your source display (for example, an 8K TV would be even sharper). In addition to the standalone Deepframe, potential customers can also embed it into an existing window or structure. So what can you do with a screen like this? Since its main focus is on AR, it's entirely meant to bring digital objects into the real world. I saw a CG velociraptor hopping around the screen, and I was surprised by how sharp it appeared on the screen. It wasn't exactly life-like, but it looked like it was almost in the room with me. I also briefly chatted with Realfiction CEO Clas Dyrholm through the display (he was in a separate room), which felt like chatting with a Star Wars hologram. At one point, he made the dinosaur instantly appear alongside him, something that looked like it would take hours of rendering just a few years ago. Devindra Hardawar/AOL Realfiction has been delivering limited holographs to stores for years, but Dyrholm sees Deepframe as a huge step beyond that. It's something museum guides could use to interact with digital objects and characters, giving attendees a size comparison between them and a giraffe, for example. In stores, customers could use...
