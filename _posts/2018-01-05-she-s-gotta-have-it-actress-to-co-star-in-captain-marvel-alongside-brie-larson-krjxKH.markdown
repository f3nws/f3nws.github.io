Aside from the news that the Netflix show is getting a second season, she's also joining the star-studded cast of Captain Marvel in a role opposite Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson. Deadline broke the news in an exclusive, but details on her role or plot details for the upcoming superhero flick are scarce.
