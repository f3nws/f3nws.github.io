Nicolas Cage has become the "Nicolastick" in Japan, thanks to some creative marketing. Ahead of December's release of his 2016 movie, Army of One , in Japanese cinemas, some theatres are offering a limited edition Nicolas Cage corn puff snack that only comes with an advance ticket purchase. SEE ALSO: The 1982 'Blade Runner' film vs. the 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' Army of One is only coming out in the Asian country a year after its U.S. debut, and its Japanese title translates more accurately to "Bin Laden is My Prey." ３時ですね、おやつの時間だー！日本を代表するおやつと言えば……うまい棒！！というわけで、『オレの獲物はビンラディン』の前売り特典が特製うまい棒“ニコラスティック”に決定！10/13（金）より、本作の上映劇場で発売開始だー！！劇場に急げ🏃🏃‍♀️💨 ※画像はイメージです pic.twitter.com/37yxueQYsW — 12.16『オレの獲物はビンラディン』 (@findingbinladen) October 2, 2017 Read more...
