The iPhone X shares the same specs with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, but it brings over a variety of features that aren’t available on the other two models. The all-screen design, the incredible OLED display, Face ID, the TrueDepth camera system, Animoji, and the improved telephoto lens on the back, are only found on the iPhone X. Add to that the A11 Bionic chip and wireless charging — also available on the iPhone 8 — and you end up with a device that’s miles ahead of any iPhone ever made. The iPhone X is also the most expensive iPhone ever made, starting at $999 in the US, and even higher in international markets. A week after buying it, I am more convinced than ever it’s the only iPhone to buy this year. And I’d pay the same $999+ price even if the iPhone X only had one feature to differentiate it from the iPhone 8 series. I could go without an all-screen design and without an OLED panel. I don’t need Animoji, and the iPhone 8’s telephoto lens would have worked just fine. It’s the TrueDepth camera system that makes Face ID possible that I appreciate the most — I still hate the notch, but that’s a story for a different rainy day. And Face ID really does change everything, no matter how corny that sounds. It was early July when I became firmly certain that the iPhone X, which we all called iPhone 8 back then, will not feature any kind of fingerprint scanning technology under the display. I wrote at the time that I hoped Apple’s facial recognition system could dazzle me just like Touch ID did, but I was circumspect. Touch ID already played a big part of my iPhone life, and I got used to it to the point that I’d unlock the iPhone well before I’d interact with it. And I thought there’s no way facial recognition would be as fast. Now that I’m using Face ID I can tell you that I was right, Face ID isn’t as fast. But I was also very, very wrong. It’s incredibly fast when you look at the much bigger picture. A synthetic comparison between Touch ID and Face ID will tell you that Touch ID is a few milliseconds faster. Add all those up, and you end up with wasted ...
