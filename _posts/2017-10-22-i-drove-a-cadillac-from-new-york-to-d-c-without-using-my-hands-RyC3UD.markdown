SEE ALSO: Self-driving cars still need to earn the public's trust But none of that really matters, because I'm here to test the new, highly anticipated self-driving feature, Super Cruise , which lets the car effectively take control on most major highways in the continental U.S. and Canada. It's one of the most advanced upgrades available in any car right now, and Cadillac claims it's "the world's first true hands-free driving system for the freeway." Read more...
