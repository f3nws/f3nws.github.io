Of note is that all potential iPhone OLED screen suppliers out there are rumored to invest billions of dollars into OLED-related plans, Samsung included. But only BOE appears to be ready to offer it an iPhone-only line. Pouring in cash into new OLED facilities isn’t enough, the report notes. BOE screen quality has to meet Appl...
