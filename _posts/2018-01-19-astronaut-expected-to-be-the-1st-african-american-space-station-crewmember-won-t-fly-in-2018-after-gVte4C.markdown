Jeanette Epps, who was set to become the first-ever African-American astronaut to be a crewmember on the International Space Station, will not fly to space in 2018 as scheduled, NASA announced late Thursday. It's not clear why Epps was reassigned from her flight. The decision pulls her from her slated mission, which was expected to launch in June. "A number of factors are considered when making flight assignments; these decisions are personnel matters for which NASA doesnâ€™t provide information," NASA spokesperson Brandi Dean said via email.
