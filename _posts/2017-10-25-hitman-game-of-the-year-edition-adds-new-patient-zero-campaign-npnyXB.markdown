When developer IO Interactive separated from publisher Square Enix, it got to keep the popular Hitman franchise, giving the now-independent studio control over the 2016 stealth shooter game it developed . Back in June, the company released the first episode of Hitman for free to attract new customers, and now it's putting out a "Game of the Year" version of the game for PS4, Xbox One and PC on November 7th. The new edition will include the entire first season, a brand new 'Patient Zero' campaign, new Escalation Contracts, new weapons, new suits, new challenges and improved graphic and lighting effects. IO Interactive's first new content release for Hitman since it went independent will contain all seven locations and more than 100 hours of gameplay, including all of the original Challenge Packs, Escalation & Featured Contracts and more than 700 challenges. The "Patient Zero" campaign is entirely new, too. It's got four missions to play through across various in-game locations as Agent 47 has to stop a global pandemic from being unleashed on an unsuspecting planet. The new edition also includes three weapon/suit combinations, the Clown suit and the "New Bat," the Raven suit and sniper rifle "Sieger 300 Ghost," and a Cowboy suit with magnum pistol "The Striker." If that's not enough, you'll get new themed Escalation Contracts that bring new complications based on the suit you're sporting. Hitman - Game of the Year Edition will be available starting November 7th for $60 digitally. If you already own The Complete Season, digital or on disc, you can grab a "GOTY Upgrade" and get the rest of the good stuff for only $20. The offer is also good for those who bought all episodes individually or bought the Intro/Upgrade Pack combination. There's also an update in the works for anyone who has the game of any version, including a redesigned UI, new Contracts Mode, all the extra lighting improvements, a commemorative Elusive Target unlock for those who completed those specific challenges, enhancements for the Xbox One X, and Tobii eye-tracking support for PC.
