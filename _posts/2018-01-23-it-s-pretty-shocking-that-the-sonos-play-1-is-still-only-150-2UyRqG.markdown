The Sonos Play:1 Compact Wireless Speaker has been the best $200 wireless speaker on the planet for so many years. Anyone who has a Sonos system at home knows how impressive this little speaker is, and first-time listeners are always blown away. During Black Friday last year, the Play:1 dropped down to $150 and it has stayed around that new price point ever since. If you missed the opportunity to start or expand your Sonos system at that killer price, you’re in luck. Shockingly, Sonos Play:1 speakers are still available at the new lower price on Amazon. There isn't another speaker priced anywhere near this range that sounds as good as the Play:1. Here are some key details from the product page: Play:1 is our compact, surprisingly powerful speaker. It’s a perfect fit for bookshelves, counters, and other snug places. So now you can enjoy great-sounding music anywhere.

Or, pump one song in perfect sync, throughout your home. Set-up in five minutes using your home Wi-Fi.
