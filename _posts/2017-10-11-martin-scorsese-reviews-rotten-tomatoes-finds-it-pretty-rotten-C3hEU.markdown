Rotten Tomatoes is the go-to site for movie fans who need help choosing what film to see next. But the scores on the movie review site, known as Tomatometer ratings, aren’t necessarily useful or indicative of a movie’s box office performance.

These firms and aggregators have set a tone that is hostile to serious filmmakers—even the actual name Rotten Tomatoes is insulting. And as film criticism written by passionately engaged people with actual knowledge of film history has gradually faded from the scene, it seems li...
