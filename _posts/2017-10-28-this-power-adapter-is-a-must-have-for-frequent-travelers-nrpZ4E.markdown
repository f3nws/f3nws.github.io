That’s just the OMNIA TA502 , aka the world’s smallest travel adapter. And don’t mistake small for less pliable — this baby’s got you covered in over 150 countries. Just slide the right plug into place, plug it into the wall, and you’re good. The USB ports ensure you can charge all of your iOS or Android smartphones and tablets safely. Read more...
