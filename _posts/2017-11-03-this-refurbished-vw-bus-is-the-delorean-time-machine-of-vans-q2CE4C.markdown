The DeLorean time machine, while iconic, also seems impractically small for everyday use. That's where this refurbished Volkswagen Bus comes in. First spotted by Road Show , this 1967 VW Bus up for sale at Velocity Motorcars in Nashville, Tennessee is, in essence, the minivan of time machines. SEE ALSO: All the '80s references you might've missed in 'Stranger Things 2' Complete with slick grey paint job, gull-wing doors, and, naturally, a Flux Capacitor , it's the kind of vehicle any Back to the Future mega fan would be happy to own. One caveat: It's listed at $89,995. velocity motorcars, llc.
