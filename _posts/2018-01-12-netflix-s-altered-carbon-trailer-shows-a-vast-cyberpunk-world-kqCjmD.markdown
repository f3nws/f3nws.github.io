We've been looking forward to Netflix's take on Blade Runner for a while now. Altered Carbon , based on the novel of the same name, even made an appearance at CES this year . Now there's a brand-new trailer to get us all excited for the upcoming sci-fi series, full of body horror, murder and (apparently) some funny moments. In the upcoming television show, a rich man 300 years in the future (played by Rome 's James Purefoy) needs his own murder solved. So he resurrects and hires Takeshi Kovacs, a soldier killed in action 250 years previously, to investigate. The show looks impressively large, with stunning environments and sets. It's a serious throwback to the cyberpunk vision of novels like William Gibson's Neuromancer and, of course, Blade Runner , itself based on a Philip K. Dick novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep . Altered Carbon is set to debut on Netflix this Februrary 2nd. Via: The Verge Source: Netflix/YouTube
