It's hard to believe that Adidas hasn't had its own shopping app, considering that we're living in the age of the smartphone. But that's all about to change. Today, the German sportswear giant is introducing its (aptly named) "Adidas" application , which will let iOS and Android users buy products without having to go to their web browser.

He pointed to the Confirmed app and site , where sneakerheads can reserve models l ike Kanye West's Yeezys , as examples of Adidas "investing heavily into the technology and security behind our experiences." ...
