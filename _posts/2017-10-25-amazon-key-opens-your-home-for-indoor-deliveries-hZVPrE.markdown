Amazon's gone to a lot of effort to make its services as convenient as possible -- free delivery, lightning fast delivery, delivery from the sky (well, soon, probably) -- now it's eliminating the need for you to even be at home to receive your packages (or to have a designated safe place), because its couriers can now simply let themselves into your property.

It also boasts night vision and two-way audio. A smart lock, Cloud Cam and installation will set you back $250 ( Prime customers can preorder the camera today, the Key service becomes available on November 8). There are no extra charges, but a forthcoming subscription service will give you access to additional features such as footage archiving, motion detection and zone monitoring. The service -- while set to revolutionize the delivery market -- feels like a huge test of trust. Are people prepared t...
