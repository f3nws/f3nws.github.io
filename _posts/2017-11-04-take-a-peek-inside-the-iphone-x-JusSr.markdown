As they tend to do , the folks at iFixit have descended upon Apple's latest creation to pull it apart piece by piece. While we didn't spot any fairie dust spilling out of the iPhone X , they did dig into its TrueDepth camera system (above) that enables all those new recognition features like FaceID and Animoji . Interestingly, Apple decided to rely on a dual-celled battery design to better utilize space behind the nearly-all-screen OLED display. In total, it packs 2,716mAh, which is just a bit larger than the iPhone 8 Plus (2,691mAh) but smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus (2,900mAh) and Galaxy Note 8 (3,300 mAh). Source: iFixit
