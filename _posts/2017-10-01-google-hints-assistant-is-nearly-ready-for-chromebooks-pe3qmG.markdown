Google's October 4th event might include more for Chrome OS fans than the rumored Pixelbook . David Cannon and 9to5Google have spotted multiple app references to Google Assistant coming to Chromebooks. Google's Home app notes that some Assistant apps will work with Chromebooks, for instance, while the Chat with your Assistant app recently started listing compatibility with the Chrome machines alongside the usual gaggle of Android releases. There was code hinting at Assistant support in the past, but these public nods suggest that support is imminent. There's no guarantee you'll see Google talking about Assistant on the 4th, but it wouldn't be at all shocking. If the Pixelbook shows up at the event, Chrome OS is going to get some time in the spotlight -- it'd be a prime opportunity to introduce a major feature. The big question is whether or not the feature will be widely available from the start, provided it launches at the media gathering. Google no doubt wants to put Assistant in as many places as possible , but it might use early access on the Pixelbook as a selling point. Via: 9to5Google Source: David Cannon (YouTube)
